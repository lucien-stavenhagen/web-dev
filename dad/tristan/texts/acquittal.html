        <pre>
There was the revelation,
certified before the world,
that Christ in all his puissance
is pliant as a windblown sleeve.
He bends smoothly and conforms,
if you know how to mold him,
as closely to the shape you want,
as indeed he rightly should.
He's ready to serve every heart
for honesty or deception,
whether in earnest or in jest—
he is always as you wish him.
All of this lay manifest
in the wily queen's example.
Her prevarication worked,
and the envenomed vow she swore,
taken before the face of God,
restored her to her place of honor,		15750
regained for her the respect,
fervent love, and trust
of her lord king Marke,
and the esteem and affection
of her land and countrymen.
Whenever the king recognized
that she had set her heart on something,
that was what he also wanted—
he granted her honors and finery.
All his heart, his whole mind,
were devoted to her, nothing else,
without any reservation.
All his doubts and suspicions
again had been extinguished.
