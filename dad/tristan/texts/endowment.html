      <pre>
Tristan in his cleverness
arrived very cleverly
at the necessary decision
that he would divide himself
between both his fathers
as though sliced in half.
He made two parts of himself
as smooth and equal as an egg
and presented then to each of them
what he knew was suited best
to the concerns of just that one.
If you have never heard about
the split dividing the whole person,
I'll tell you how this split is made:
No one, I'm sure, has any doubt
that two things go to make a man,
what I call person, and property.
from these two comes a noble mind
and many a worldly honor.
But if you separate the two,		5700
of property you make poverty.
The person, if it is despised,
quickly loses its repute,
leaving the man half a man,
even though just one person.
All this goes for woman too—
be it either man or woman,
still must property and person
make common cause
to yield one whole name.
But if they're separated, 
there's nothing left of either.

Following this reasoning, 
Tristan went into action
with foresight and vigor.
He ordered brought together
fine mounts and noble dress,
victuals and all supplies
needed for festivity
and published the occasion.
He summoned and invited
the finest in the land,
with whom its power rested.
They did as friends and allies do,
assembling as commanded.
Tristan too was ready,
having made all preparations.
On two youths he bestowed the sword,
sons of his father Rual,
thus constituting them as heirs
after their father Rual.
And anything on that occasion
he could give at his own cost
to their honor and position,
he was ever ready to show
a sincere will to do it,
as if they were his own sons.
Now they have attained knighthood,
each with his own twelve attendants.
One among those followers
was the courtly Curvenal.
The distinguished Tristan
took his brothers by the hand,
mindful of courtly ceremony,
and by hand led them out. 
All his kin and his retainers,
any who at that time
by years or by maturity
or perhaps by both
could use informed consent,		5750
all of them were summoned
and invited to come to court.
--<q>Now, my lord, they're all here.</q>
Tristan rose to stand before them.
<q>Gentlemen,</q> he addressed them,
<q>to whom I'm ever pleased
to render such service 
truly and persistently
as much as lies in my power—
kinsmen and esteemed retainers,
by whose grace it is I hold
whatever honors God has granted,
it is by your assistance
that I have now accomplished
everything my heart desired.
What God may have granted,
still I know very well 
it was realized with your support.
What more can I add to that?
Just in these latter days
you have risked your goods and welfare
on me in so many ways
that I can have no doubt at all
that this world would sooner have to end
before any of you at any time
would set yourselves against me.
My friends, men, and all of you
assembled here at my wish
or by your own sense of worth,
let what I now have to say
not displease you greatly.
I declare and say to you all, 
as my father Rual, present here,
has both seen and heard,
that my uncle has bequeathed
his land into my hands,
and also intends, on my behalf, 
to renounce a legal wife
so that I shall be his heir,
and wishes me to attend him always,
wherever he may go or stay.
Now I have decided, 
and it is my firm intention,
to fulfill all his requirements
and return to be with him.
Such revenues and dues
as in these lands are mine, 
I bestow in trust as fief
upon my father Rual,
as his in perpetuity,			5800
whatever be my fate in Curnewal,
whether it be well or ill, 
should I prevail there or die.
And here stand his sons before us,
with others of his descent.
They shall follow him as heirs,
and have every right to this.
But I remain sovereign,
and will hold that power in my hand
all the days of my life.</q>

Cries of grief and lamentation
broke out among the knighthood.
They were thrown into uncertainty.
All their confidence was lost.
<q>Oh, master,</q> said one of them,
<q>we would have been much better served
never to have laid eyes on you.
That would at least have spared us
this hurt you do us now.
Lord, our reliance and our belief
depended so much on you,
as though you gave us each life.
Nay, but now that life for all of us
which we expected to enjoy
has perished and lies buried
if you abandon us now.
Lord, you have only increased, 
not decreased our sorrow.
It seemed that our fortunes
were just beginning to rise a little,
only now to fall again.</q>
Yes, I know, sure as death,
just how strong for all of them
the grief and sorrow was
that this announcement caused.
Rual, who came out well ahead,
receiving great benefits,
and much increase in wealth, 
was affected even more deeply
with dismay than all the rest of them.
This endowment, so suddenly—
God knows, he never had received one
so painfully before.
