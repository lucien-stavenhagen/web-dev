      <pre>
Now when Tristan's uncle Marke
and his countrymen had heard
that he was returning in new health,
the king and all his people
everywhere in the realm
rejoiced with heartfelt gratitude.
The king, much devoted to him,
asked to hear of his adventures.
Tristan related the whole story
from beginning to end
as accurately as he could.
All who heard it marvelled,
but soon exchanged their wonder
for much laughter and mirth.
They remarked with fond amusement
how he had voyaged to Irlant
where she who was his enemy
had cared for him so tenderly,
and at how he had flourished
there among their foes.
Never before had they heard
of something so extraordinary.
When his tale was finished
and they had had their merriment
about his voyage and healing,			8250
they began to quiz him seriously
about the maiden Isolt.>

<q>Isolt,</q> he started, <q>she's a girl—
what all the world takes as beauty
pales to nothing, compared with her.
The bright Isolt—now there's a child
in manners and in bodily charm
such that no girl nor child of woman
so pleasing or so elegant
has ever yet or will be born.
Isolt, pure and brilliant,
shines brighter than Arabian gold.
All the things I imagined
when I read in books
written only to praise
Aurora's daughter and her child,
the far-famed Tyndarean,
how in that woman alone
the beauty of all women
was brought together in that one flower—
by that I am deceived no longer.
Isolt has cured me of that error,
and never again shall I suppose
that the sun rises from Mycenae.
Perfect beauty dawned not in Greece—
it is here that it shines.
Now all thoughts and all men
have but to look toward Irlant.
There let their eyes find delight—
let them see the new sun
following the rosy dawn,
Isolt the maid, Isolt her mother,
shining into every heart
from Develin's horizon!
A light so delightful
it enlightens every realm!
All those who say in praise of women
whatever they say, and think it's praise,
compared to this, are saying nothing.
Whoever sees Isolt in person
finds his heart purified
just as the fire refines the gold.
It refreshes life and body.
Nor does she eclipse the beauty
of every other woman,
as many a tale would have it.
Her own beauty beautifies—
it coronates and decorates
woman and the name of woman,
of which no woman need feel ashamed.</q>		8300>

When Tristan had finished describing
from his own personal experience
his lady the maiden princess,
the wondrous delight of Irlant,
whoever had been present and heard,
and read the words with his heart,
found the story sweetened his mind
as does the dew of May the blood.
All who had heard were inspired.
Tristan began his life again,
now with a different outlook.
A second life had been granted him—
he was a man as though reborn.
Things began to move again,
and he was filled with eagerness.
King and court, all together,
seemed to be on his side,
until an insidious agitation,
whose accursed name is envy
(which rarely long lies dormant)
began to do its work among them.>

For many a lord it darkened
his disposition and behavior,
and some began to begrudge
Tristan's high station and honor
with which the court and the people
now generally regarded him.
Soon they were talking maliciously
about all his accomplishments
and circulating rumors
that he was a sorcerer.
Concerning the current tales
of his victory over Morolt
and his escapades while in Irlant,
they soon agreed among themselves
that such things were done by enchantment.
<q>Now look,</q> they said, <q>consider this,
and tell us, how could he ever
have overcome the giant Morolt?
And how deceive Isolt,
the all-knowing queen,
his mortal enemy, no less,
into caring for him tenderly
until she had in fact cured him?
What a marvel, listen here!
How this clever operator
can cloud the sight of those who see
and thus attain whatever
he may intend to do!</q>
Now those admitted to Marke's counsel		8350
formed a plan among themselves
to advise Marke strongly
and always with persistence
as though from great concern
that he ought to take a wife
by whom to get an heir,
be it a daughter or a son.
But Marke said, <q>God himself
has provided us a successor—
please God, long may he live!
For so long as that may be,
and know ye well that this is final,
never shall there be a queen
or a royal lady at this court.</q>>

This only raised their enmity
and their jealousy of Tristan 
to such a high degree
that soon it reached a point
where it could not be contained.
Being no longer able
to conceal their feelings about him,
they both spoke and acted
on ever more occasions.
He began to be alarmed,
and now had to fear constantly
that somehow and in some way
the royal council would conspire—
would go so far as to murder him.
He requested his uncle Marke
in God's name to consider
his danger and anxiety
and do whatever it was
these envious barons were demanding—
he could not know, at any moment
whether the next might be his last.
His uncle, the discerning king,
replied, <q>My nephew Tristan,
say no more.  I will not.
I want no other heir than you.
And put an end to your fears
about your life and your person.
You shall have my protection.
All their jealously and anger—
what harm, by God, can that do you?
enmity and jealousy—
the worthy simply have to bear them.
A man increases in true worth
all the while he is envied.
Worth and envy go together
as do a mother and her child.		8400
Worthiness always breeds
and has to bear jealousy.
who more excites animosity
than the man of high fortune?
It is a feeble luck indeed
that fails to gather enmity.
Spend your life striving to be
one day at last free of hate,
and never will you succeed at that—
you'll always have enemies.
But if you want to court the favor
of wicked folk, then sing their tune
and be a rascal just as bad—
they'll envy you no longer.
Let these men do what they may.
You must remain always aware
that you are made of finer stuff.
Never fail to look ahead
to your own honor and advantage.
And give up trying to talk me into
doing something against your interests.
I'll pay no attention to such nonsense
from you or from anyone else.</q>>

<q>Then give me, Sire, your command
to leave the court,</q> Tristan requested.
<q>They are more than I can handle.
If they have set themselves against me,
I can't expect to continue here.
If I had a world to govern
of kingdoms so contentious,
by far would I prefer
never to have a realm at all.</q>
When Marke saw his determination,
he bade him say no more, and answered,
<q>Nephew, as much as I would like to be
constant and loyal on your behalf,
regrettably, you do not let me.
Whatever comes of this affair,
I'll not be held accountable.
But anything I can do for you,
that I am ready and willing to do.
Tell me then, what do you want?</q>
<q>Call together those councillors,
the ones who maneuvered you into this,
and ask each one his opinion.
Find out what it is they wish
that you should do in this matter—
when you know what they really want,
it can be settled honorably.</q>>

This was accomplished without delay.		8450
Once they had all been assembled,
the course of action they advised
was intended only to destroy Tristan.
They declared that the lovely Isolt
would make for the king a perfect wife,
in her person, high birth, and aptitudes.
They ratified their standing counsel.
Before Marke in plenary session
one of them was delegated
to deliver for all in one voice
their unanimous opinion:
<q>Sire,</q> he said, <q>we think this good.
The lovely Isolt of Irlant,
as is well-known in all the countries
neighbor both to us and them,
is a maiden and a child 
on whom the height of womanhood
has bestowed every blessing
that could possibly be awarded.
As you yourself, many times,
have heard it said of her person,
she is fortunate and perfected
in life as well as in body.
If she may now become
wife to you and our mistress,
for us here on earth
no better lady could be chosen.</q>
<q>But sirs, consider,</q> the king replied,
<q>if indeed I wished to have her,
how could that come about?
You must always bear in mind
how things stand and long have stood
between us and the Irish—
land and people are our foes.
Gurmun hates me heartily,
and with good reason, as I do him.
Whoever could restore between us
a state of friendship and peace?</q>
<q>Sire,</q> the spokesman answered,
<q>it comes about often enough
that there is strife between peoples.
Then both sides should take counsel
to seek and find a remedy,
and together with their children
be reconciled again.
Out of great enmities
often come strong friendships.
Give this matter your attention,
and you may yet see the day
when Irlant comes under your rule.		8500
The land is held by only three.
The present king and his queen
have as heir Isolt alone.
She is the only child they have.</q>>

To this speech Marke answered:
<q>Yes, Tristan has moved me
to think earnestly about her.
She has been much on my mind
as he spoke her praises to me.
Because of this preoccupation
I have come to prefer
her above all others.
Unless she becomes mine,
never on this earth
shall another be my wife,
by God and by my own life.</q>
But with this oath he didn't mean
that now he favored their plan
any more than formerly.
It was but a calculation,
since it remained unthinkable
that such a thing could ever be.
But the royal councillor continued:
<q>Sire, you have but to command
that my Lord Tristan, standing here,
who is familiar at that court,
deliver your proposal there.
That will accomplish all our aims
and do it at a single stroke.
He is wise and very clever,
and fortunate in his ventures.
Surely he can succeed in this:
he knows all their languages,
and he does what he sets out to do.</q>>

<q>That is wicked advice,</q> said Marke.
<q>You concern yourselves too much
only for Tristan's destruction.
Already once he has tasted death
for you and your progeny.
And now you would have him
die yet again.
No, no, ye of Curnewal,
you may do this thing yourselves,
don't tell me to use him for it!</q>>

<q>Wait, Sire,</q> Tristan said.
<q>This is not bad advice.
It would be most effective,
whatever your desire might be,
that I should sooner undertake it
and more willingly than any other,		8550
and it is right, that I should.
I'm the man, Sire, to do this.
I can best present your courtship.
Just command all these lords
to accompany me on the voyage,
to see to all your best interests
on the way there and back.</q>
<q>No, no, never again
shall you fall into foreign hands,
from which God has once saved you.</q>
<q>Nay, Sire, this must be done.
Whether they shall live or die,
I must also share their fate.
They shall see for themselves
that if this land has no heir,
whether it be my fault or no.
Command them to make ready now.
I will captain the ship myself
and steer it with my own hand
to the happy isle of Irlant,
once again to Develin,
to that source of sunshine
that bears joy to many a heart.
Who knows, perhaps she will be ours—
Sire, if you gain the lovely Isolt,
and cost it the death of us all,
that were a small price to pay.</q>
Now when Marke's councillors
heard the way the talk was going,
they had never in all their years
been quite so downcast
as at the results of this debate.
