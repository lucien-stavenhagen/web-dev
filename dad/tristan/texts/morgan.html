                <h2>Morgan</h2>
            </header>
      <pre>
<p class="firstline">Once, I think, you pleased to hear</p>how Marke welcomed his nephew dear.
Now I hope you'd like to hear
of Tristan's welcome in his homeland dear.
<p class="firstline">It was their leader,</p>Rual the true and dependable,
who first debarked onto land.
Then removing his cap and coat,
as an act of courtesy,
he ran laughing to Tristan,
and kissing him, said, <q>my lord,
be welcome here in God's name,
to your own land and to me!
Now observe: do you see
this handsome land on this shore?
Secure cities, strong defenses,
and many a splendid castle.
See, all this your sire Canel
left to you as heritage.
Be strong and ever on your guard,
and none of this you see here
can ever be taken from you.
Of that I'll be your surety.</q>
And with this address he turned away		5200
pleased and satisfied at heart,
and joyfully began to greet
each of the knights in his turn.
With his remarkable eloquence
and many charming expressions
he saluted them in welcome,
then led the way to Canoel.
The cities and their fortresses
throughout the entire land
which in Canel's time
had been under his command,
he now rendered to Tristan
by the custom of loyalty,
together with his own, 
which had come down to him
through his own forebears.
What need of any long description?
He had property and standing,
and as a man so endowed
rendered them to his lord,
with the support of all his men.
Such diligence and care
as he devoted in every way
and with such willingness
to the advantage of all of them
no eye has ever seen before.

But wait—how did this happen to me?
It seems I just forgot myself—
whatever was I thinking of?
the gracious marshallin,
faithful and virtuous, 
my good lady Floraete—
that I have failed to mention her
was hardly a proper courtesy.
But I shall compensate her
and do proper penance.
She is courtly and kind,
even of temperament,
worthiest and best—
I know she received her guests
not merely with polite talk,
because whatever talk she made
was informed with full sincerity.
Her heart rose to the heights
as though by means of wings.
What she said and what she meant
were never two different things.
She went overboard, I know, 
in matters of hospitality
whenever she received guests.		5250
This blessed Floraete—
what delights her heart enjoyed
in her master and in her child—
the boy this story's all about,
yes, I mean her son Tristan—
I can know in some detail
from the many and sufficient
virtues and the services
she showed and did, as I have read.
This in her was no small gift,
as she clearly demonstrated
the way a woman best can,
by assuring for her child
and for all his people
every honor and convenience
that men of knighthood ever had.

Thereupon the summons went
to every corner of Parmenie,
to every lord and his men,
to all of those who held power
in the cities and the castles.
When they had come together
in company at Canoel,
and saw and heard in person
the truth about Tristan,
as the legend has informed us
and as you yourselves have heard,
there rose a thousand shouts of welcome
from each and every mouth.
Land and people both
began to rouse from torpor
and rediscover joys
miraculously.
Their fiefs, their subjects, and their lands
were reconfirmed to every one
by their lord Tristan's hand.
They vowed fealty and were accepted.

But throughout all these ceremonies,
Tristan had concealed the pain
secreted in his heart
that Morgan still caused him,
a pain that gave him no respite
at any hour of the day.
Therefore he held counsel
with kin and pledged retainers,
declaring his intention
to hasten to Britanje,
there to confirm his fief
from the hand of his enemy,
thus the better to secure			5300
his claim to his ancestral land.
And having said he would, he did. 
He set out from Parmenie
together with a company,
well aware and well prepared
as any prudent man should be
who makes up his mind
to venture into danger.
Having arrived in Britanje,
Tristan happened by chance to learn
from local talk, well confirmed,
that the duke Morgan rode hunting
from one forest to another.
He ordered his men to hasten,
the knights to arm themselves,
concealing under their mantles
their armor and their weapons
such that no gleam of mail
should show through clothing.
This they did, this was done,
and over all, each of them
pulled his riding cape closed
and thus disguised, mounted.
Their pack train and attendants
they ordered to return,
not stopping for anyone.
They divided their armed men,
sending the larger part of them
to accompany the returning train
as protection for men and goods
on the way they had to pass.
When this was done,  there remained
of those to go with Tristan
a good thirty knights or so,
leaving as a rear guard
sixty men, or more.
Very soon, Tristan's party
came in sight of hounds and hunt.
In answer to his inquiry
as to where the duke could be found,
they gave directions readily.

Following their indications
it didn't take him long to find
in a forest clearing
a band of Britunish knights,
whose elegant pavilions
and tents were pitched on the grass,
in bowers woven all about
with flowers amid the greenery.
Their hunting hawks and packs of hounds		5350
they kept near at hand.
They also greeted Tristan
and all his followers
with customary courtesy,
and then told him readily
that their lord Morgan was riding
quite nearby in the forest.
They hastened in that direction.
There they found Morgan
with many Britunish attendants
very well mounted.
And as they made their approach,
Morgan received his guests,
not knowing their intentions,
with all the proper courtesy
that visitors should be shown.
So did his fellow countrymen,
each of whom came forward
to make his salutation.
Then after the time it took
to complete these formalities,
Tristan spoke to Morgan:
<q>Sir, I have come here to you
concerning my fief, and desire
that you confirm it to me here
and by no means refuse to me
what by all rights I should have.
You thus do well by custom.</q>
<q>Sir, tell me,</q> Morgan replied,
<q>your origin, or who you are.</q>
Tristan then declared himself.
<q>My birthright is of Parmenie,
and my father's name was Riwalin.
Sir, I am his rightful heir,
and my own name is Tristan.</q>
<q>Sir,</q> said Morgan, <q>you're bringing me
useless old stories
that were far better forgotten
than told yet again.
This doesn't interest me.
If you had any claims on me,
you would be quickly satisfied,
since nothing would deny to you,
if you be of proper lineage,
each and every privilege
to which you have a right.
But we know well, all of us
(the tale has spread, far and wide)
all about how Blanscheflur
fled from home with your father,		5400
what kind of honors she attained,
and the outcome of that companionship.</q>
<q>Companionship? What do you mean?</q>
<q>I don't need to explain it to you. 
What I said is clear enough.</q>
<q>Sir,</q> said Tristan, in reply,
<q>I see what you're telling me.
You are saying I was born
outside of legal marriage
and therefore have no further claim
to my fief or to my holdings.</q>
<q>Yes, indeed, my fine knave,
that's how I see it, and so do others.</q>
<q>That's wicked talk,</q> declared Tristan.
<q>I was under the impression
that it was only polite
when you insult someone
to know what you are talking about.
That, at least, is decency.
If you had any, or any sense,
as badly as you've abused me,
you'd be careful what you say
to cause me more grief
and bring up old scores.
You're the one who killed my father.
Maybe you think that's not enough
of an affront to me,
so now you say the mother who bore me
did so whorishly.
God almighty help me!
I know how many a noble man,
more than I'm going to count here,
put his folded hands in mine.
had they blamed me for this vice
that you have just accused me of,
never would a one of them
have given me his hands in pledge.
For they well know the truth,
that my father Riwalin
went to his death
with a lawful wife, my mother.
If I need to prove this by your neck,
that every word I say is true,
be assured, I'm ready and willing.</q>

<q>Goddamn you,</q> snarled Morgan, <q>be off!
What do I care for your proving?
You've got no right to fight anyone
who has legal courtly standing.</q>
<q>We'll see about that,</q> said Tristan,
drew his sword, and went at him.		5450
He clove him down from the crown
through brain and skull, all the way
as far as where the tongue lies.
And quickly again he thrust the sword
aiming this time at the heart.
And so the proverb about old debts
which once stored never decay
was proved to be true enough.
All of Morgan's men,
hot-blooded Brituns,
could now do nothing for their lord,
nor come so quickly to his aid
as to prevent his defeat.
But they were ready, every one, 
to fight back, and fight hard. 
A strong force of them soon gathered.
Although taken by surprise,
they advanced on their enemies
plainly meaning business.
They paid no attention
to the conventions of sportsmanship,
but massed together in a rush,
and by sheer numbers forced the fight
out of the woods into a clearing.
There arose mighty shouting, 
loud crying and despair,
as though Morgan's death flew
on a cloud of lamenting
mounting up on wings.
It announced sad tidings
through every stronghold in the land.
Everywhere there flew at once
a single cry of despair:
<q><i>a noster sires, il est mort</i>!
Who shall preserve our homeland now?
Gather quickly, champions,
from every town and castle,
pay back these strangers
for the hurt they have done us!</q>

Soon enough a strong pursuit
attacked from the rear.
But the invaders always met them
with powerful sorties in reply.
Again and again they sent back
a numerous detachment
that struck down many a pursuer,
but the band continued in retreat,
striving to locate their reserves.
Soon they found their men at arms,		5500
and with all of them together
took refuge on a hill,
and there were able to spend the night.
But darkness gave the country's forces
time to gather in strength
such that their unwanted guests,
as soon as day began to break,
suffered yet stronger pursuit.
They lost many casualties,
their formations often broken
by sword and spear assaults,
although these didn't last long.
The average life of sword or spear
was very short in that battle.
They used up many a one of them
in mass charges by both sides.
And it was the smaller force
that fought harder in defence,
doing all the greater damage
when the foe breached its ranks.

Now the forces on both sides,
began to suffer greater losses,
ever increasing as time went on.
They dealt out and suffered losses,
striking down many a man.
But still they went at each other
until the isolated force
began to weaken in defense,
losing men while the foe increased.
Indeed the attackers kept gaining
both in forces and in position,
so that before night fell again
they held the invaders trapped
behind a moated rampart,
within which they made their stand
and managed to survive the night.
Thus the fighters were besieged,
surrounded by an army
like and unbreakable fence.
These alien strategists,
Tristan and his followers,
now what were they going to do?
I'll tell you how it all came out,
how they overcame their troubles,
escaping from the trap
and conquering their enemy.
Since Tristan first had set out
following Rual's advice
to have his fief confirmed
and then to return quickly,		5550
the prudent Rual
had not ceased to worry,
for in fact he suspected
the very fate that befell Tristan.
Although he hadn't divined
the story of Morgan's end,
he mustered a hundred armed knights
and set out after Tristan,
following his trail closely.
It didn't take him very long
to arrive in Britanje,
and there he heard very soon
exactly what had happened.
Using this common knowledge
he directed the line of his march
toward the Britunish encirclement.
As they began to approach
within sight of the enemy,
no one in their ranks
needed to be ashamed
of having fallen out of line.
They charged in a single body
with all pennants flying.
Their battle cry resounded
above their formation:
<q><i>schevelier Parmenie</i>!
Parmenien cavalry!</q>
Wave after colorful wave
galloped havoc and destruction
through the stays and guyropes.
They pushed back the Brituns
through their own camp
with many a fatal wound.
As soon as the besieged
saw and knew their colors
and heard their own war cry,
they began a breakout
and soon were in the open.
Tristan went on the attack.
Heavy losses were inflicted
on those countrymen.
Capture and slaughter,
slashing and thrusting
soon began to penetrate
through their ranks, front and rear,
and now with their reinforcements,
both attacking companies
shouted together in chorus:
<q><i>schevelier Parmenie</i>!</q>
Soon they met no more resistance.		5600
There was no regrouping
nor any fight left in them
other than hiding and retreat,
making off at speed
for the woods and safety.
The fight was now much dispersed.
The best defense they had was flight,
their best chance to escape death.

When this rout had been completed,
the knights took a needed rest,
making temporary camp,
and bringing in their comrades
who lay dead on the field,
they buried them properly.
Then they took up the wounded,
and improvising litters
set out for their homeland.
Thus Tristan had received
his own fief and his lord's
confirmed by his own hand.
He now was lord and liege of him
from whom his father got nothing.
Now he had justice,
and had settled his affairs--
justified belongings,
settled sense of pride.
His wronged right now was right,
his injured pride smooth and proud.
He now had firmly in his hand
all his land and heritage,
incontestably,
since no one, as the matter stood
had any claim to any of it.

At this time his thoughts returned
once more to Curnewal, 
to the advice and invitation
from his uncle, when he set out,
all the while not forgetting
his gratitude toward Rual,
who had never failed to do him
so many a valuable service
with fatherly concern.
His heart inclined strongly
toward Rual and toward Marke;
all his mind was on these two,
divided equally between them.
This may move someone to ask:
how shall Tristan, in such fortune,
now conduct his affairs
to satisfy both of them,			5650
giving each his proper due?
Surely everyone must see
that such a thing's impossible
without neglecting one of them
and taking sides with the other.
--So tell us, how shall this work out?
If he now returns to Curnewal,
he abandons Parmenie
and the prominence it lends him,
leaving Rual much bereft
in pleasures and in spirits,
deprived of all the benefits
that should assure his happiness.
But if he wants to stay there,
he never will attain
to yet greater honors,
and disregards Marke's counsel,
to whom he owes his high position.
Now how shall he save himself?
God knows, he must go back.
We'll simply have to grant that.
He needs to rise in station
and gain in self-esteem,
if he is to reach
genuine success.
Indeed he should pursue
high honors gladly.
If Fortune means to grant them,
she is right to do so, 
since he so desires them.
