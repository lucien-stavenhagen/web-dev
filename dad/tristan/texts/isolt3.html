            <h2>Isolt III</h2>
        </header>
        <pre>
Kaedin's sister, Isolt,
she of the white hands,
the blossom of that realm,
was wise and high-spirited,
having so distinguished herself
as to conquer the hearts and minds
of the entire population,
which could speak of nothing else
but how good and excellent she was.
When Tristan looked on her beauty
it refreshed his distress.
All his old heartache
tormented him anew.
Always she reminded him
of another, former Isolt,
that clarity of Irlant,
and being named, like her, Isolt,
whenever his gaze dwelt on her
the name itself was enough
to throw him into bleak depression
such that everyone could see
the anguish in his heart.

And yet he loved these very pangs,
welcoming them fervently.
To him they were sweet and right.
He cherished this unhappiness
because she was good to look upon.
Therefore he liked to look at her
because his pain at the loss
of his former blonde Isolt
was sweeter than all other joys.
Isolt was his pain and his delight,
yes, Isolt, his consternation.
She delighted him, she caused him pain.
The more Isolt broke his heart
by the very name Isolt,
the more he watched Isolt with pleasure.
He told himself, many times,
<q><i>a de benie</i>, how this name
has thrown me into confusion!
It turns and twirls and twists
the truth together with lies
in my mind and before my eyes.
It puts me in a wonderful plight—
Isolt laughs and disports			19000 
all the time in my ears,
and I cannot tell where she is.
This eye of mine that sees Isolt—
this same eye sees her not.
Isolt is far, yet here with me—
I fear I have been Isolted
now for the second time.
Out of what was Curnewal
some magic has made Arundel,
Karke out of Tintajel,
and Isolt out of Isolt.
I cannot help but think
when someone speaks of this maid
under the name of Isolt,
it is Isolt I have found.
It's all so bewildering,
how strangely things have happened.
To see Isolt once again
is something I have longed for,
and here I am, where Isolt is,
but still am nowhere near Isolt,
however close to Isolt I am.
I see Isolt every day
and see her not.  It's misery.
I have found Isolt here,
although it's not the blonde one
who causes me such sweet distress.
It is Isolt, who filled my mind
so busily with these ideas,
on whom my heart dwells ceaselessly,
but it's the one of Arundel,
and not Isolt <i>la bele</i>,
the one my eye doesn't see.
And yet, whatever I look on
that bears the seal of her name
I am obliged for all time
to hold in my heart's affection,
and bless for its beloved name
that has so often given me
delight and a delightful life.</q>

With imaginings such as these
Tristan often bemused himself
when he saw his gentle nemesis
Isolt <i>as blanschemains</i>.
She freshened the fire in his mind
with the glowing hot embers
which smouldered always in his heart,
burning there night and day.
This had driven from his mind
all martial thoughts of knighthood.		19050
Now his heart and ambitions
ran entirely toward love
and gentle satisfactions,
while trying to arrive at them
by a devious route.
He had set all his intentions
on love or its facsimile
for the maid Isolt,
ready to compel his feelings
to love for her in hopes
that his oppresive yearning
might with her be made lighter.

He began now to cast 
intimate glances in her direction,
unleashing them so often
that she was entirely convinced
of his tender feelings for her.
She too, before this,
had often thought of him
and considered the situation.
Having seen and heard so much
of his high reputation
throughout the court and the land,
she found her heart inclined toward him.
Thus when Tristan began
to turn his gaze upon her
as though by chance, and let it rest,
she replied with her eyes
to this man so eloquently
that he began to consider
by what means or device
he might be able in this way
to gain complete release
from all his heaviness of heart.
He took every opportunity
to see her, whatever the time,
whenever at all possible.

It didn't take Kaedin long
to notice their exchange of glances.
Now he brought Tristan
more often together with her,
for if she should win his heart
he might take her and remain,
which offered Kaedin the prospect
of Tristan's help in subduing
and governing the whole land.
And so Kaedin enlisted
his sister Isolt
to make Tristan a proposition
which he would tell her how to phrase,		19100
as long as nothing should be done
without his and her father's consent.
Isolt was pleased to do
what she wanted to do anyway,
and encouraged Tristan openly.
She started using on him
all the talk and behavior
that entrap and constrain thought,
bring love to life in the heart,
in every way and everywhere,
until she had set the fire
that made her name sound
so soothing in his ears
as before it had distressed him.
Now he heard and saw Isolt
more gladly than he had intended.
Isolt was likewise affected,
looking on him with much affection.
Each dwelt within the other's thoughts,
and soon they pledged to each other
love and companionship,
which they put into practice
every time they had the chance
to do so circumspectly.
