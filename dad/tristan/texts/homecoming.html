      <pre>
When the ships approached Curnewal
within so close a distance
that the coast was clearly seen,
all on board rejoiced greatly—
all, that is, with exception
of Tristan and Isolt.
It brought them only anxiety,
and had they been able to choose,
they never would have made landfall.
Their fears about their own honor
began to weigh on their hearts.
They could devise no plan at all
for what they should do or how
the problem of Isolt's maidenhood
should be concealed from the king.
Yet however inexperienced
childlike lovers may be
in the childhood of their love,
a solution did dawn on the child.
<p class="firstline">Simple children, too, may play</p>at love, in their childish way.
 And then indeed they may display
wit and cunning to find their way.
<P class="firstline">Let me come right to the point.</p>Isolt in her youthfulness
hit upon a subtle trick,
the best she could on short notice.
All they had to do, she said,
was to persuade Brangaene
that she should spend the bridal night
alongside Marke, their lord,
to give him her companionship,
but being careful to keep silent.
Hardly could he be better cheated,
since she was lovely and intact.
So it is that passion teaches
otherwise honorable minds
how to practice deception,
which on their own ought not know		12450
what's required for stratagems
so false as this one.

The lovers went into action.
They prevailed upon Brangaene
after much and long persuasion,
bringing her to the point at last
of promising faithfully
to go through with it as they wished,
although most unwillingly.
More than once she blushed hotly
or paled at such an obligation,
which indeed tried her severely,
so strange a subterfuge did it seem.
<q>Sweet lady,</q> said Brangaene,
<q>your mother, my mistress,
our own blessed queen,
commended you into my care.
I myself should have kept you
from this trouble on our way
and on this accursed voyage.
Now you have sorrow and dishonor
because of my negligence.
I have little right to complain
if I must bear this scandal with you—
it would indeed be only just
for me to bear it alone,
if you might thus escape it.
Merciful Lord in heaven,
how hast Thou so forgotten me!</q>

Isolt, puzzled, asked her, 
<q>proud cousin, tell me,
what is it that so troubles you?
What are you so upset about?</q>
<q>Lady, several days ago
I threw a bottle off this ship—</q>
&mdash;<q>Well, what's so dreadful about that?</q>
<q>Ah,</q> she cried, <q>that was the glass—
it had that drink in it—
that's the death of you both!</q>
<q>How so, cousin?</q> said Isolt,
<q>what on earth&mdash;?</q> &mdash;<q>All right, I'll tell you,</q>
and Brangaene told them everything,
starting from the beginning.
<q>God save us,</q> Tristan exclaimed,
<q>whether it be life or death,
that was a most soothing drink.
I know not how that death may be—
this one surely is a pleasure.
If my death is to be
always Isolt, my delight,			12500
gladly will I look forward
to dying in eternity.</q>
<p class="firstline">Leave all the talk aside.</p>If we with love abide,
we cannot leave aside
how sorrow must abide.
<p class="firstline">Soothing indeed love may be,</p>but still, with all its pleasures,
we must not forget honor.
whoever stubbornly pursues
only delights of the flesh
may say farewell to good repute.
Well as the life Tristan lived
may have pleased him at the time,
his sense of honor still restrained him.
Loyalty overrode all else—
to adhere to its requirements,
he must bring Marke a wife.
Two laws, faith and honor,
afflicted him sorely
in heart and in mind.
Those laws, having already
lost the fight to Passion,
when he chose love over them,
came back from their defeat,
driving Passion from the field.

Tristan sent out two launches,
carrying messengers to the harbor
to bring Marke the news
of how they had succeeded
with the beauty of Irlant.
Marke spread the word at once,
sending whomever he could find,
a thousand messengers everywhere,
to summon the nation's knighthood.
A powerful host was there to welcome
both returnees and new guests.
In receiving these two parties,
the finest and most fateful
with whom he would spend his life,
he gave them such a welcome
as might be expected of a man
getting what he valued most.
Marke at once instructed
the returning council of barons
to present themselves again at court
within the next eighteen days
all prepared suitably
to attend his marriage.
Complying with these commands,		12550
they appeared in all their finery,
as did a splendid company
of knights and highborn ladies
all eager to be delighted
at the sight of brilliant Isolt.

Indeed they were compelled
to stare at her and marvel,
and from all was heard one cry:
<q><i>Isot, Isot la blunde
marveil de tu le munde</i>&mdash;
Isolt, the one and only,
a marvel, the whole world over!
Everything that people say
about this blessed girl is true.
She pours delight upon the world
just as does the shining sun.
Never did any realm
possess a maid so beautiful.</q>
She was formally betrothed
and her rights ratified,
that both Curnewal and Engelant
were given into her hand,
but that Tristan should succeed
if she bore no heir.
Thereupon she was acclaimed.

For that night, when she would go
to sleep with her lord Marke,
she, Brangaene, and Tristan
had made every effort
well in advance
to plan the time and occasion
as carefully as possible
for every eventuality.
Now, just the four of them
were present in Marke's chamber,
the three along with the king.
Marke retired to his bed.
Brangaene quickly dressed
in the queen's raiment,
she and Isolt having assumed
each other's usual costume.
Tristan led Brangaene 
to an anxious martyrdom,
while Lady Isolt put out the lamp.

Marke clasped Brangaene to him.
How she liked the first part
of this encounter, I don't know.
She submitted so compliantly
that there was no sound at all.
Whatever bid her partner made,		12600
she followed suit and repaid
all that he demanded of her
both with brass and with gold,
in full value as he required.
I am sure of this, at least,
that rarely since this transaction
has brass of such quality
been used to pay a bride-price
that was due in gold.
I would bet my life on this,
that since the days of Adam
so fine a fake has not been coined
nor so valuable a counterfeit
put to bed with any man.

As long as king and maid lay
indulging in their bed games,
Isolt suffered all the while
the greatest anxiety.
She kept thinking to herself,
<q>dear God, now preserve me,
all I ask is that my cousin
be true to me in there—
if she keeps up the bed-play
too long and too thoroughly,
I fear she may so enjoy it
that daylight will catch them,
and then every one of us
will be common laughingstock.</q>
But no, she played her role
fairly and with thoughtfulness.
Once she had done for Isolt
all that she should have,
she got up and left the room,
having paid the price demanded.
Isolt at once took her place,
sitting down beside the bed,
as though the same person.
The king called for the wine,
following the usual custom
that was practiced at that time
and generally observed—
when a man lay with a maiden
and had taken her maidenhood,
a celebrant would bring wine
and have both drink of it
as though the two were one.
They performed this custom there.
Tristan, the nephew, brought at once
both the wine and a lamp.
The king drank, then the queen.		12650

There are, of course, many tales
that say this was the draught
that cast Tristan and Isolt
into their hearts' agony.
No, no, that drink was gone—
Brangaene threw it overboard.
They had conformed to the rite,
both having drunk, as was the custom,
and now young Queen Isolt
lay down apprehensively,
with many an unspoken pang
in both mind and heart
beside the king, her lord.
He at once resumed his pleasures.
He pressed her close to his body—
to him a woman was a woman,
and very soon he found this one
to be very well favored.
They were all alike to him.
In any of them he found
both gold and brass.
She too paid him his price,
just then and just there,
and he never knew the difference.
