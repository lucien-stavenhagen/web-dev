            <h2>Restoration</h2>
        </header>
        <pre>
No sooner had the king departed
than Isolt awoke, and also Tristan.
They looked around in puzzlement
for the accustomed sunbeam,
which however now came in
only at two windows.
They examined the third one,
which, much to their surprise,
no longer admitted any light.
Without any further delay
they rose and went to investigate.
Climbing the outside of the stone
they very soon discovered
the leaves, blossoms, and grass
heaped up before the window.
Also, plainly to be seen,
up on the <i>fossiure</i> and before it,
were the tracks of men's feet,
both coming and retreating.
Much alarmed by this,
they now had cause to fear
that Marke, as they could imagine,
had somehow found his way there
and had been able to spy on them.		17650
This notion, being circumstantial,
could afford them no certainty—
The evidence proved nothing.
But still they had the reassurance
that whoever had discovered them
could only have seen them lying
turned well away from each other
in the pose they had devised.

Immediately the king summoned
his council and his kinsmen
at court and in the land abroad
for an advisory session.
First, he announced to them
the circumstance of his discovery,
as I have just narrated,
and declared that he would hear no more
about any misdemeanors
respecting Tristan or Isolt.
His councillors saw at once
that he had made up his mind,
and could read between the lines
that he wanted to have her back.
They counselled him, as wise men do,
in accordance with his heart
and as they knew in fact he wanted—
that he should at once recall
his wife Isolt and his nephew,
inasmuch as he knew nothing
inconsonant with their honor
and would never again pay attention
to malicious gossip about them.
They sent at once for Curvenal,
entrusting him as messenger
to carry the decision to them,
since he knew the situation.
The king confirmed his favor
both toward Tristan and the queen,
declaring his respect and love,
asking them to return
and to consent not to harbor
further ill will against him.

Curvenal sped on his way
to announce Marke's change of heart.
The lovers welcomed his news
which gladdened their hearts also.
Their joy, however, was occasioned
much more by being reconciled
with God and salvaging their honor
than for any other issues.
Again they set foot on the path		17700
leading back to their sovereignty,
although, in all their years remaining
never again would they enjoy
the same easy familiarity
nor would they have such freedom
for their trysts as before.
Nevertheless, Marke himself,
as well as court and retainers
honored them assiduously,
although now no longer
so freely or so openly.
Marke, the veteran of doubt,
commanded and implored
both Tristan and Isolt
to behave with due modesty
for God's and his own sake,
avoiding and refraining from
those very sweet liaisons
of intimate glances
and the cozy exclusiveness
of secret conversations.
These restrictions pained them,
but Marke again knew happiness.
