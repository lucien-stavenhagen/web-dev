            <h2>Trial</h2>
        </header>
        <pre>
Marke in his confusion
was now seriously weighed down
from brooding incessantly
over how he should go about
resolving this dilemma
and dispelling these delusions—
to throw aside the load
of doubt from his own mind
and cleanse the court itself
from the insinuations
that he himself harbored
concerning his wife Isolt
and his nephew Tristan.
He summoned all the princes
on whose counsel he relied.
Making his displeasure known,
he told them how these rumors
that had sprung up in the court
had reached the point of threatening
his own marriage and honor.
He declared, that while he doubted
the allegations against them
that had become generally known
and widely disseminated,
he would now grant his queen
no more personal intimacies
until she confirmed publicly
her innocence and faithfulness.
He besought their advice
as to how he should dispel
all doubts as to her failings
with a final judgment, yes or no,
in consonance with his honor.
His confidants and retainers		15300
unanimously advised him
to convene a grand council
at Lunders in Engelant,
and there present his case
before the gathered clergy,
those learned church scholars
who so well know divine law.

The council was duly proclaimed
with venue at Lunders
following Whitsuntide
in the latter part of May.
The priesthood and the laity
gathered there in great numbers
in response to the royal summons,
as the king had ordained,
also Marke and Isolt,
both much discomfited
with anxieties and fears.
Isolt feared greatly
for her life and honor,
and Marke was concerned
that his pleasure and dignity
would be much impaired
because of his consort Isolt.
Now Marke, presiding at the council
laid his plaint before the barons.
He was aggrieved, he said,
because of this vicious tale,
and charged them stringently
before God and by their honor
to devise and promulgate,
if it lay within their power,
some stratagem or remedy
enabling him to do justice
or avenge this ill, if need be, 
thus laying it finally to rest,
however the verdict might fall.
This gave rise to much discussion
and opinions freely expressed,
some favorable, some not,
some well-meant, some otherwise.

One of the princes then arose
of those in attendance at the council,
by both years and learning
well-qualified to advise,
commanding of stature and mature,
as gray as he was wise,
the Bishop of Thamise.
Leaning on his staff, he said,
<q>My Lord and King, now hear me.		15350
Ye have brought us here before you,
princes all, we of Engelant,
by loyalty and right of counsel
of which you now stand in need.
I, too, am of princely rank—
Sire, I hold my place among them.
I am so far advanced in days
that I may well do as I please
on no authority but my own
and speak my mind without reserve.
Let each of them speak for himself—
for my part, Sire, I will declare
my own thoughts and opinion.
If my idea seem good to you
and earns your favor, then hearken
to my counsel and to me.
My Lady and our Sir Tristan
are suspected of impropriety,
yet neither has been convicted
by any sure proof or evidence,
if what I hear is correct.
How shall you counter hostile talk
with hostile countermeasures?
How are you to pass judgment
upon your nephew and your queen,
upon their honor and their lives,
since they have not been detected
in any kind or sort of misdeed,
nor can such crimes be plainly proved?
Comes now someone accusing Tristan
of this or that indecency,
without bothering to prove
the charge, as by law he should.
Someone, say, brings disrepute
and slander upon Isolt,
although without evidence.
But in consideration
of the court's deep suspicions,
it would devolve upon you
to avoid the queen's company
either in bed or at table,
until she prove her innocence
both toward you and toward her country,
in which this slander is widespread
and repeated freely every day.
Unfortunately, tales like this
find ready ears everywhere,
whether for truth or falsehood.
Be it truth or fabrication
that this slander circulates,		15400
those who see evil in it
easily instigate
more dangerous assumptions.
Whatever may be behind it all,
whether it is true or false,
the slander and imputation
have spread so far through idle talk
as to cause you personal injury
and earn the court's condemnation.
Now this, My Lord, is my advice—
considering that My Lady, the queen,
stands accused in this fashion
of such and such delictions,
let her be summoned to appear
before us all, here in council,
to reply to your questioning,
that we may hear both sides of it,
as this court has every right to.</q>
<q>Sir, I concur,</q> the king replied.
<q>Your address and advice
please me and seem proper.</q>

Isolt was sent for, and she came
before the council in the palace.
When she had been properly seated,
the bishop of Thamise,
advanced in wisdom and years,
conformed to his king's commands.
He arose and addressed her, 
<q>Lady Isolt, most virtuous queen,
let what I say not offend you.
My Lord the king commissions me
to speak here in his name,
and I but do his royal will.
Now be God himself my witness,
that whatever, and unwillingly,
I may here bring to light
inpinging on your dignity,
that I do with great reluctance.
Ah, that this might have been spared you!
Most blessed and excellent queen,
he who is your lord and sovereign
delegates me to question you
about a general public offense.
I do not know, nor does he,
whence this imputation arose,
except that there is much talk
in the court and the whole country
involving you and Sir Tristan.
If God wills, My Queen, My Lady,
you shall be held innocent		15450
of any such indiscretions.
He is nonetheless aware
of much gossip pervading the court.
My Lord himself has found nothing
that might incriminate you at all.
But from stories pervading the court
his doubts have been aroused,
not from any kind of evidence.
On these grounds he addresses you,
so that his friends and his retainers
shall hear for themselves
whether he can put an end
to this circulating lie and slander
with the support of this council.
It seems to me well-conceived
that you should defend yourself
by answering to every question
put to you in our presence.</q>

Isolt, always aware, 
the undeceived queen,
when it came her turn to speak,
rose from her place and addressed them.
<q>Your Majesty, My Lord Bishop, 
Barons of this land and court,
now hear this and know it well.
If My Lord's reputation
or my own is in question,
I am more than ready to speak,
now and at any other time.
My Lords all, well I know
that for a year now, at least,
how stories of my depravity
have spread throughout land and court.
You also know, one and all,
that none can live so purely
before the world and at all times
as might be perfectly desired,
above every taint or censure.
It thus is no surprise to me
that I should be called to answer.
I expect no immunity
from charges or imputations
of misconduct or impropriety,
the more so as an alien
with no one to rely upon,
neither allies nor relations.
No one here stands by me,
no one sorrows for my sorrow.
All of you, every one,
be he poor or powerful,		15500
is ready to believe
how unclean I am.
If I but knew some way,
what remedy to seek here,
how to make my innocence
credible in your eyes
and thus restore in full
My Lord's tainted honor,
my first wish would be to do so.
How, then, do you advise?
Whatever test may be required
I am prepared to undergo,
that every possible suspicion
be at last done away with,
but in addition, above all,
that My Lord's and my reputation
be established beyond reproach.</q>

<q>My queen and lady,</q> said the king,
<q>with this I will be satisfied.
That I may have final justice,
as you yourself have proposed,
you shall give us certainty.
Appear before the general court,
submit yourself to the test
of laying hold of the blazing iron—
this is our royal decision.</q>
The queen accepted the verdict,
pledging to appear for trial
as the council had decreed,
after six weeks had elapsed
in the city of Carliun.
The council then was dismissed,
the king and royal barons departed.

Isolt was left there alone,
much troubled with apprehension.
Trouble and worry together
oppressed her more than ever.
She worried for her reputation,
and now the secret fear pursued her
that the truth of her untruthfulness
was going to be put to the test.
Between these two anxieties
she hardly knew what to do.
She began to lay this dilemma
upon the mercy of Christ
who is ever ready to help in need.
To him she commended fervently
amid much prayer and fasting
all her anguish and distress.
Trapped as she was by circumstance,		15550
she invented a ruse in her heart,
relying on God's courtliness.
She wrote down and sent
a letter to Tristan,
bidding him come to her
if he could possibly manage it
in Carliun on the morning
of the day she would arrive there,
and watch for her on the landing.

This was accomplished.  Tristan came,
in disguise as a pilgrim,
having much disfigured himself
with stained, swollen face,
and much changed in body and dress.
When Marke and Isolt arrived
and were approaching the dock,
the queen spotted him at once,
easily recognizing him.
Just as the ship touched land,
Isolt commanded her retinue
that not they, but yon pilgrim
if indeed he had the strength
should perform the office she required,
to be enlisted, in God's name,
to take her up and carry her
across the gangway to the landing,
since at a time such as this
she would permit no knight to do so.
A chorus of voices quickly called,
<q>hither with you, holy man,
bear my lady to the landing!</q>
He complied, as commanded.
Taking up the lady, his queen,
he enfolded her in his arms
and started to bring her to land.
Isolt at once whispered to him
that as he came to the dock
he must pretend to stumble
and fall down together with her,
whatever be the consequences.
He did as she had directed.
As he first set foot on land,
the supposed pilgrim sank down
and fell as though by accident,
but judging his fall carefully
so that he landed next to her,
in her arms, at her side.

They did not rest there long—
a swarm of royal attendants
armed with staves and clubs		15600
went at the fallen pilgrim
to work him over thoroughly.
<q>No, no, stand back!</q> Isolt exclaimed.
<q>This pilgrim could not help himself.
He is frail and much weakened—
he fell by no fault of his own.</q>
Instead of violence, they began
to praise her for her grace
and estimate her to themselves
for charitably refraining
from punishing the poor man.
Isolt said, with a smile,
<q>would it not be very strange
if this man, on pilgrimage,
wanted to have fun with me?</q>
This only brought her further praise
for her virtue and courtliness.
Her honor was on every tongue
and every man respected her.
Marke watched, as all this happened,
hearing everything they said.
Isolt then went on to say,
<q>I don't know what will happen next.
Surely all of you must see
that now I cannot take an oath
never to have held a man
except for Marke, in my arms,
nor that no other ever
lay with me at my side.</q>

So, with much good-humored joking
about the prostrated pilgrim,
they mounted and began the ride
for the gates of Carliun.
Gathered there were many a baron,
high prelates and armed knighthood,
and common folk in great numbers—
the bishops and the clergy
who were there to read the mass
and sanctify the proceedings
were also in full readiness
to perform their appointed office.
The iron had been put in the fire.
Isolt, the good and pious queen,
had distributed her finery,
all her silver and jewelry,
her gold and other possessions
such as horses and fine garments,
that God should grant her leniency
for her actual transgressions
and restore her to full honor.		15650
She had then entered the church
where she listened to the mass
with sincere devotion.
The queen in her wisdom and goodness
performed her reverence piously.
Next to her body she wore
a penitential hair shirt
and over this a woollen cloak
that reached down to no more
that a hand's breadth above her ankles.
Its rough sleeves she had rolled
nearly up to her elbows,
exposing arms and feet bare.
Many a heart and many an eye
looked with compassion on the sight,
her rude clothing and appearance
attracting the notice of everyone.
And now the relic was presented
upon which she was to vow.
Thus Isolt was adjured
to confess her transgressions
before God and the world.
Isolt had already rendered
her life and honor to God entirely.
She stretched forth her hand and heart
anxiously, with good reason,
to touch the relic and make her oath.
With both hand and heart
she gave herself into God's grace
for preservation and protection.

There were many there
of unfriendly disposition
who would gladly formulate the oath
the queen would be required to take
in such a way as to entrap her.
That bitter gallnut of envy,
the seneschal Marjodoc,
was always working here or there
in every way to bring her down.
Many others were inclined
to grant her full respect
and give her every advantage.
The argument raged back and forth
as to what the oath should say—
this one against her, another for,
as people do in such matters.
<q>My Lord and King,</q> observed Isolt,
<q>whatever anyone may say,
my oath must be formulated
to your own satisfaction.		15700
Therefore consider this yourself,
as to what I say or do,
if this will be acceptable
as my solemn vow before you—
there's far too much advice here.
Now hear, what I will swear to you:
that never has any man
had knowledge of my body
nor at any time has another
now living lain in my arms 
or beside me, excepting you 
and him, whom I cannot deny
nor abjure with any vow
whom you with your own eyes
saw lying in my arms,
that impoverished pilgrim,
so help me My Savior
and all the saints there are 
to attain righteousness
through this ordeal.
If that is not sufficient, Sire,
I will amend what I swear
however you may require.</q>
<q>My Lady,</q> the king replied,
<q>that seems to me enough,
as far as I can judge.
Now take the iron in your hand,
and as to what you specified,
God be your aid in this trial!</q>
<a name="15730">
<q>Amen,</q> returned the lovely Isolt.
In God's name she grasped the ingot,
carried it, and was not burned.
