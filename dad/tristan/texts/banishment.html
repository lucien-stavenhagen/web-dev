            <h2>Banishment</h2>
        </header>
        <pre>
Again Tristan and Isolt
had overcome their tribulation,
and were at ease in the court,
while the court again paid them full honor,
according them their highest renown.
They enjoyed again the confidence
of Marke, lord to both of them.
They also took great precautions.
Whenever they were not safely able
to enjoy each other's company,
the desire to do so served
as recompense for true lovers.
Just looking forward to the ways
by which might be accomplished
that which the heart longs for
always inspires the heart
with lust for life and new power.
This is intimacy at its best,
replenishing both love and passion
with their highest meaning&mdash;
whenever the deed is forbidden
that would give passion its full sway,
to be willing to abstain
and take the will for the deed.
When the will is firm enough,
although there be no chance to do it,
the urge to do it can be stilled
with a will firm enough.
Playmates and companions
should never will too strongly
what situation forbids,
lest they will themselves trouble.
It's always a losing game
to want what you cannot have.
Want what is possible—
that's a better way to play.
It causes much less heartbreak.

When the players Isolt and Tristan
had no opportunity,
they let it go at that,
knowing what they both wanted.
They traded desire back and forth
delightfully between them 
in an energetic game.
Love in common, common minds,
this they knew was sweet and good.
The pair of lovers concealed
their love at all times			16450
before the court and from Marke
to the utmost extent
permitted by the blind love 
that suffused both of them.
However, love's enmity
and its seed are such
that wherever it is strewn
it quickly strikes roots
and thrives so fruitfully
with such generous yield
from very little watering
that it hardly ever wilts
or can be eradicated.
Ever-bearing suspicion
soon enough began
to wrap Tristan and Isolt
in its tendrils and rank growth.
It was watered all too well
with suggestive behavior
which gave evidence enough
of unrelenting passion.
It has been truly said
that no matter how we deny it,
there are two affinities:
the eyes for the heart,
and the finger for the itch.
Those lodestars of the heart
are always searching eagerly
at the direction of the heart,
just as the hand and the finger,
over and over, no matter what,
go straight to the itch.
Just so did the lovers.
By no means were they able
to avoid what they most feared,
even inviting suspicion
with many a tender glance,
often and repeatedly—
unfortunately, as I said,
the eyes, those servants of the heart,
always followed the heart's direction
as the hand reached for the itch.

The two of them, between them,
soon began so to entangle
their eyes and hearts with one another
that they couldn't disengage
from the thicket of their glances
quickly enough to prevent
Marke from detecting
the fragrant balm of passion,			16500
by which he finally saw through them.
His eye never missed its target.
He always saw, without their knowing,
the truth shining through their eyes
without needing anything else
except what showed in their faces.
What he saw was so tender,
so sweet and full of yearning,
that it went straight to his heart
and filled him with such rage,
such envy and such hatred
that those two old irritants,
doubt and suspicion,
ran all together into one.
Insult and anger
overrode discretion.
It was death to his senses
that his heart's love Isolt
should give her affections
to anyone but himself,
for he esteemed nothing
more highly than Isolt,
an allegiance he always kept.
In his unrestrained fury,
his beloved woman still
was dear and dearer than his life,
and yet, however adorable,
this intolerable burden
and uncontrollable chagrin		
obliterated all of that,
leaving nothing but the fury
which consumed him entirely.

Now he cared not one hair
if there was any truth in it.
Blinded by his pain and anger,
he summoned the two of them
to the palace, before the court,
with all retainers in attendance.
There, in public, he told Isolt
before the eyes and ears of all.
<q>Lady Isolt of Irlant,
this whole land and people know
the gossip that has linked you
how long now—and since when—
to my nephew Tristan.
Well, I have tried everything,
all sorts of tests and stratagems,
to get you to rein in
this foolishness for my sake,
and yet, for me, you will not.		16550
I am not such a fool
as not to know, when I watch you
that your heart and your eyes
both openly and in secret
are fastened on my nephew
every hour, day and night.
You show and render him
sweeter attentions that you do me.
From such behavior I understand
that I mean less to you than he.
Whatever precautions I take
as to you or to him
accomplish nothing at all.
All of it goes for naught,
however much I may try.
I have kept you two apart
physically as much as possible,
and so it surprises me no end
that your hearts still are as one,
always, after all this time.
I have interrupted 
your sweet looks of love
and yet I cannot interrupt
this love you bear each other,
which I have already borne too long.
Now I come to the point.
I will no longer tolerate
this depravity and shame
that you have tried so hard to hide
but still inflicted upon me.
I'll not stand for this dishonor
ever again, from this moment.
Yet I am unwilling
to take such revenge on you
as by law indeed I should,
if that were what I wanted.
Tristan, nephew, Isolt, wife,
that I should execute you both
or cause you some great grief—
you are too dear to me for that,
however it pains me to say so.
Since I see that you both
are always given to each other
more fervently than you love me,
as much as I regret it,
now go and be with each other
to your own satisfaction.
Don't refrain for fear of me.
Since your love is so great,
I will not, from this time on,		16600
compel you or interfere
in any of your affairs.
Take each other by the hand
and then--get out of my land.
I will neither see nor hear you
cause me any more trouble.
We were once three companions,
but that can now no longer be.
I leave it all to you two,
and will retire from it alone,
tear myself away somehow.
Yes, this threesome is vile!
I'm glad to set things to rights.
A king, who mixes in affairs
of passion with his eyes wide open—
that's utter debauchery.
Go, both of you, in God's protection.
Live your lives and love
however your desires may dictate,
but our companionship is over.</q>
