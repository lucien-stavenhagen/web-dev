            <h2>Kaedin</h2>
        </header>
        <pre>
There was a dukedom situate
between Britanje and Engelant,
also bordered by the sea,
which was called Arundel.
The ruling duke at that time,
advanced in years, but bold and courtly,
had been oppressed, the histories tell,
by powerful neighbors
who had violated and usurped
his jurisdiction and territories.
They had put him to rout
both on land and at sea.
Gladly would he have retaliated
had he had the power to do so.

There were one son and a daughter		18700
born to him and his wife,
both of high perfection
in stature as well as virtue.
The son had taken the sword,
greatly devoted to its cause.
For some three years past
he had earned high praise and honor.
His sister was a lovely maiden,
named Isolt <i>as blanschemains</i>,
the son was called Kaedin <i>li frains</i>.
Their father was Duke Jovelin,
and their mother, the duchess,
bore the name Karsie.

When the news reached Tristan
at home in Parmenie,
that war had broken out
in the land of Arundel,
he thought to find diversion
from his sorrows there.
Leaving Parmenie behind,
he headed for Arundel,
arriving at a great castle
known everywhere as Karke,
where the lord of the land resided.
Here he made his first stop.
Duke and retinue received him
as a man of worth shoud be received.
Well they knew his reputation.
Tristan, as this story tells us,
was famous over all the islands
that lie fronting the great ocean
for his deeds of manliness,
and they were very glad to have him.
The duke was ready to comply
with his advice and directives, 
bidding him to take command
of his lands and situation.

The young and courtly Kaedin
was very eager to please him.
If there was anything he could do
to promote his guest's worthiness,
he devoted himself to that
with his full attention.
Very soon the two of them
were competing with each other
at all hours and all times
to be of service to the other.
They vowed loyalty and companionship
between themselves, one to one,
and remained true to each other		18750
as long as they both lived.
Tristan, the outsider here,
taking Kaedin with him,
had an audience with the duke.
He asked him in consultation
about the military state
between him and his enemies,
from which quarters they were able
to inflict on him the great losses
that had so overwhelmed him.
Everything was explained to him
concerning the tactical situation,
including the best that they knew
about the enemy's position
and which way they were advancing.
The duke did have control
of an advantageous stronghold
that lay across the enemy's path.

Tristan and Kaedin his ally
moved at once to invest it
with the few combatants they had.
It was not such a force
as would be able to take the field
for a pitched battle on short notice,
but still enough to sally out
when occasion warrated,
using stealth and surprise
to devastate enemy lands
by pillaging and burning.
Tristan dispatched a summons
in secret to Parmenie,
informing the sons of Rual,
his dedicated followers,
of his need for reinforcements,
which he required now as never—
this was the time to demonstrate
what they really could do
by bringing help immediately.
They delivered a regiment
of five hundred cavalry
with the finest equipment
and a great store of supplies.
As soon as Tristan heard
that his native forces were coming,
he went himself to meet them
under cover of darkness,
leading them across the border
without anyone else knowing
except for friends and allies
who were eager to aid this effort.		18800
He stationed half of them at Karke,
giving them strict instructions
to keep themselves out of sight,
avoiding any engagement
if forces attacked Karke
until they could be certain
that he and Kaedin were in the field.
Then they were to sally out
and see what fortune should bring.
He took command of the other half,
riding with them on the path
to the fortress assigned to him,
bringing them within its walls
by night, and told them to conceal
their strength just as carefully
as would those back at Karke.
At the first light of morning,
Tristan had already detailed
from the knights he had brought
a troop of at least a hundred.
The rest were left in reserve.
He asked that Kaedin
put his own men on alert.
If they saw that he himself
had been forced to retreat,
they should come to his relief
from the fortress and from Karke.
Then he crossed into enemy space.

With no stealth or pretence,
he pillaged and put to the torch
every opposing stronghold he found,
nor did he spare their settlements.
Before nightfall the cry
had flown throughout the land
that Kaedin in his pride
was riding forth to mount
a general offensive.
Rugier von Doleise
and Nautenis von Hante
and Rigolin von Nante,
enemy captains all,
were much perturbed at this news.
All troops and resources
that could be reached by night
were mustered in full strength.
They had joined their forces
by a little before noon
on the following day
and marched against Karke.
Among their number they could count		18850
a good four hundred cavalry,
which gave them full confidence
of soon investing the castle
as they had often done before
whenever it was their pleasure.

But Tristan was on their trail,
along with his comrade Kaedin.
Just when the approaching army
considered any harassment
to be most unlikely,
their pursuers came flying at them.
None of them had supposed
they were anywhere near the enemy.
But as soon as they realized
that they were attacked on all sides,
they closed ranks at once
and turned to give battle.
Suddenly it was spear to spear,
horse to horse, man to man,
so furiously against each other
that they wrought much destruction,
both on this side and on that.
On this side Tristan and Kaedin,
Rugier and Rigolin on that.
Whoever challenged with the sword
or sought a target for his lance
had no shortage of opponents.
They flung forth their battle-cries,
here <i>schevalier Hante,
Doleise</i> and <i>Nante</i>!
there <q>Karke and Arundel!</q>

When the knights in the stronghold
saw how the fight was going,
they came streaming from the gates
to hit their foe on the flank.
Now they were among them,
attacking and fighting viciously.
It didn't take very long 
for them to break through their ranks.
Then they rode through them slashing
like wild boars among the sheep.
Now Tristan and Kaedin
began to fight their way
toward the banners and insignia
where the enemy captains were.
Soon Rugier and Rigolin
and Nautenis were captured,
after their fighting forces
had suffered many casualties.
Tristan of Parmenie			18900
with a band of his landsmen
rode about striking down,
killing, or capturing the enemy.
When those few still resisting
saw that fighting back was useless,
it was every man for himself,
to survive or escape
by flight or by subterfuge,
and no one had a better option—
surrender, flee, or die&mdash;
it was clear who had won.

All resistance on one side
now having been overthrown,
with prisoners taken under guard
and put in safe confinement,
Tristan and Kaedin
mustered their whole force,
all their resources and power,
and invested the entire land.
Wherever they found an opponent
or discovered enemy property,
be it goods, cities, fortresses,
all was forfeit, on the spot.
Collecting their gains and plunder,
they sent it all back to Karke.
Now that they had pacified
the entire hostile territory,
revenged the insult they had suffered,
and ruled the country unopposed,
Tristan dismissed his forces,
sending his fellow countrymen
back home to Parmenie
with many and sincere thanks
for the success and honor
he owed to their assistance.

When his support had departed,
Tristan turned to diplomacy.
His policy toward the prisoners
was one of rehabilitation.
They received from their new lord
the fiefs he returned to them
and his pledge of amnesty,
with the added stipulation
that there must now be an end
to this despoilment of the land
of which they had been guilty.
With this they were released,
all the captains and their men.
As the fruits of this campaign,
Tristan reaped praise and honors		18950
at court there and among it people.
Both nobility and commoners
acclaimed his manhood and wisdom,
proving themselves well disposed
to do whatever he commanded.
