                <h2>Parricide</h2>
            </header>
      <pre>
Isolt was much cherished
by her lord, King Marke,
beloved and looked up to,
honored and celebrated
by all the land's people.
Since she was seen to have
so many gifts and virtues, 
whatever had tongue to speak
loudly spoke her praises.
Meanwhile, from time to time
she and her special <i>amis</i>
had many chances for diversion,
to take their pleasure early or late,
for no one thought this unusual.
There was not a man or woman
who saw anything improper in it.
She remained, after all,
everywhere under his protection,
and so could do as she pleased.

Soon she began to consider
and review her whole situation.
No one knew of her deceit
and the trick she had used
with the exception of Brangaene.
Were it not for her alone,
she might have no fear at all		12700
about her good reputation.
This concern grew on her
as she began to worry
that Brangaene might possibly
have some feeling for Marke
that would lead her to betray
the whole story of her disgrace
and how it all came about.
The queen in her imagination
is an example, in this affair,
of how people often
fear scorn more than God.
She summoned two servants,
unfamiliars from Engelant,
and required the two of them
to swear oath upon oath,
and give surety upon surety,
then commanded them by their lives
that whatever task she gave them,
it should be accomplished
and kept strictly secret.
Then she told them her design,
revealing murderous intentions:
<q>This is what I require.
I'm sending a girl with you,
for the three of you to ride
right away, and secretly,
somewhere into the forest,
far or near, I care not,
wherever it may suit you,
as long as no one knows about it.
When you're there, cut off her head,
but pay attention to what she says,
and report every word to me.
Bring me back her tongue as proof.
And you may be assured of this:
however I may arrange it,
on the very next day
I will create both of you
full members of the knighthood,
grant you fiefs and rewards,
so long as then I shall live.</q>

They confirmed her instructions.
Isolt sent for Brangaene.
<q>Brangaene,</q> she said, <q>look at me—
do I seem pale to you?
I don't know what's wrong with me—
my head hurts, very badly.
You must gather us some herbs.
Unless we do something			12750
about this situation
I think it will be the end of me.</q>
Faithful Brangaene replied,
<q>My Lady, your discomfort
greatly distresses me.
There's no sense in waiting.
Send me wherever you will,
that I can obtain something
that will help you in your pain.</q>
<q>Yes, I have two servants here.
Ride with them.  They'll show you where.</q>
<q>Of course, My Lady. That I will.</q>
She mounted and rode away with them.

Soon they came to the forest
where  grew herbs, sprouts, and grasses 
in such plenty as she needed.
Brangaene wished to dismount there,
but the riders led her further on
into the wilds and desolation.
When they reached the thickest part,
far from any field or clearing,
they seized the courtly girl,
always loyal and worthy,
seating her there on the ground
with sorrow and misgivings,
and both drew their swords.
Brangaene, out of sheer fright,
fell flat on the earth
and lay there a long time.
Her heart pounded, her limbs trembled.
At last, in shock, she looked up.
<q>Mercy, sirs,</q> she implored,
<q>before God, what are you doing?</q>
&mdash;<q>You must now leave this life.</q>
&mdash;<q>Ah! But why? You must tell me!</q>
<q>What have you done,</q> one asked, 
<q>against the queen? She has commanded
that you be slain.  Now that must be.
Your death has been decreed
by your and our Lady Isolt.</q>
Brangaene, folding her hands before them,
cried in tears, <q>Sirs, no,
by your kindness and by God,
at least suspend this command&mdash;
let me live long enough
that I may give you an answer.
Then kill me, and do it quickly.
You must say to my lady
and know this, yourselves as well,
that never have I offended her		12800
in any matter that I supposed
might cause her any trouble,
unless it be one thing,
and that I can hardly credit.
When we two sailed from Irlant,
each had a certain dress.
We had chosen these two
and carefully selected them
from all other garments
to bring with us on the voyage—
two smocks, as white as snow.
While we were still at sea
but approaching our landfall here,
the sun began to shine so warmly
that during the day she could seldom
bear to have anything on
other than just her smock,
still so white and so clean—
thus she grew very fond of it.
Soon she was wearing it so much
that she rather overdid it
and badly soiled its pure whiteness.
But I had put mine away
carefully in my wardrobe,
concealed there and preserved
in all its pure, white folds.
Then when my lady landed here
and took the king as her lord,
the time came to sleep with him,
but her smock was not unused,
so clean as it rightly should have been
and as she would have wished it.
So I did lend her mine, 
although I forgot myself so far
as to do it unwillingly—
unless this is what troubles her,
God well knows, that otherwise
never did I at any time 
go against her wish or will.
For God's sake, I ask you,
give her my best greetings,
as serving girl to her mistress.
And may God in his mercy
preserve her and guard her honor,
watch over her life and well-being.
May my death be forgiven her.
Now I yield my soul to God,
and my body to your requirements.</q> 

The two squires exchanged looks
filled with consternation			12850
and took pity on the girl
so pure in her tearful fervor.
They both felt the greatest regret
and a deep sorrow seized them
at ever having undertaken
to commit such a murder.
Having found no reason at all,
nor being able to invent one,
that she deserved to die
and therefore could be killed,
they withdrew to talk it over,
and came to an agreement.
Whatever might befall them,
they would let her live.
The faithful two then bound her
high up in a tree,
lest the wolves come and take her
before they were able to return.
Then they caught one of their hounds,
and having cut its tongue out,
they took that and rode away.
These two servants then told
the murderous Isolt
that they had killed her as ordered,
with much grief and lamentation.
Both of them declared the tongue
that they had brought to be hers.
<q>Now tell me,</q> Isolt demanded,
<q>what information did she give?</q>
They told her what they had heard,
from the beginning to the end,
concealing nothing of it from her. 

<q>Yes, but was that all?</q> she asked.
&mdash;<q>Yes, My Lady.</q>  <q>Ah, alas,</q>
cried Isolt, <q>what a dreadful story!
You miserable murderers,
what do you think you have done?
You're going to hang, both of you!</q>
<q>But, Mistress,</q> they stammered,
<q>what do you mean by this talk?
Most marvelous Lady Isolt,
you yourself strictly charged us
and requested earnestly 
that we should take and kill her.</q>
&mdash;<q>Request? What's this about request?
I trusted my handmaiden to you,
into your protection and care
for her safety on the way
to fetch certain things for me
that would be for my benefit.		12900
You will restore her to me,
or it will cost you both your necks—
you wicked, murderous vipers,
both of you are going to hang
or be burned at the stake!</q>
<q>Surely,</q> they tried to protest,
<q>Lady, in your heart and your mind
you're being neither pure nor fair—
your tongue can't be trusted.
Lady, suspend your vengeance.
Rather than throw away our lives,
we'll give her back to you
unharmed, safe and sound.</q>
<q>Stop your lying,</q> Isolt shrieked
through a shower of tears,
<q>that's enough. Is Brangaene
still alive or is she dead?</q>
&mdash;<q>Wondrous Isolt,  she's alive.</q>
&mdash;<q>Ah, bring her here to me,
by all I promised you before&mdash;
that indeed you shall have.</q>
&mdash;<q>As good as done, Lady Isolt!</q>
Isolt held one of them there,
while the other rode at speed
back to where they left Brangaene
and returned her to her mistress.
When she had been thus delivered,
Isolt took her into her arms,
kissed her cheeks, kissed her mouth,
once and a thousand times.
The two servants she rewarded
with twenty marks of gold
upon their word of honor
never to tell what had happened.
