        <p>Gottfried himself, of
            course, was translating. After a curiously admonitory address to an
            otherwise unknown Dieterich, he combatively validates his source,
            then bravuras an ancient and popular myth into verbal music,
            expressly and exclusively for a membership inured to normal fate. A
            very interesting <I>captatio</I>. More later as to it, the myth, and
            the membership.
        </p>
        <p>We all translate, all the
            time. We must. You convert everything I broadcast, in whatever sort
            of language (not limited to the verbal spectrum), by whatever medium,
            into your own personal idiom (if you are interested at all). And if
            I'm singing strange harmonies&mdash;do we translate music?
        </p>
        <p>When an ethnologist (I
            think it was Turnbull) played recorded Mozart to jungle Africans,
            they gathered to listen intently, but didn't start building viols.
            One afternoon not long ago when an itinerant troupe of Cameroonian
            drummers set downtown Bonn athunder, I stopped along with strollers
            to admire the impact of their antic enthusiasm. They were
            disappointed, I'm sure, when we (except me) failed to dance, as did
            famously Gerald Durrell with the Fon of Bafut. Music may cross the
            barrier of unknown tongues, if we permit, without necessarily taking
            the tongue's habitat along. But when we try to make lexical sense of
            splendid verse in another language, what happens to the <I>virtud
                fundamental</I>&nbsp;? Can't we take it, at least some of it, along?
            <q>It is a contradiction essential to a work of art that it
                resists paraphrase and translation, and yet that it can only exist
                within a language, which implies the possibility of paraphrase and
                translation as a necessary condition</q>. &ndash;Charles Rosen, <cite>The
                Classical Style, 22.</cite>
        </p>
        <p>All right, first I'd
            better reject any concept of a systematic discontinuity between what
            we might distinguish as either verse or music. If you want to argue,
            please first go match E. H. Whinfield's scholarly recital of Omar's
            quatrains against Edward FitzGerald's beloved song of them. See? Or
            rather Hear? No, I mean <I>feel</I>. The difference is music.
        </p>
        <p>For now, let's tour the
            case before us. A. T. Hatto Englishes Gottfried's above quatrain
            thus: <q>We do wrong to receive otherwise than well what a good
                man does well-meaningly and solely for our good</q> (<cite>Tristan,
                Penguin [1960], 41.</cite>) To further alert me to its music, he could have
            scored it, perhaps, as:
        </p>
        <div class="onecol">
            <p>we
                do wrong to receive<BR>otherwise than well<BR>what a good man does
                well-<BR>meaningly and solely for our good.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Not bad music&mdash;sturdy
            ictus, fun with jazzy syncopation at lines 3/4, muscular
            refrain&mdash;although not primarily so intended. Still, an abject
            <I>nolo contendere</I> to Gottfried's intricate rhyme and structure
            puzzles. Professor Hatto's aim was to put the narrative, lexical
            content of the story into a form most nearly incontestable for
            readers of English, with as little distraction as possible, supported
            with as much clear and compact reference as necessary. He's
            Gottfried's Whinfield. You should borrow his work while trying to
            read mine.

            Germans:

        <div class="onecol">
            <p>Wer
                das, was ein vortrefflicher Mann in bester Absicht<BR>und nur zum
                Wohle der Welt tut,<BR>anders als mit Wohlwollen<BR>aufnimmt, der
                handelt unrecht. (<cite>Tristan, Reclam [1995], 11</cite>)
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>Krohn aims
            philologically, disregarding audiotonics, with facing Middle High
            German text (which for a modern German is about as obscure as Chaucer
            for you). If your German works, at least for reading, you need to
            have this version also (if it doesn't, abandon all hope of critical
            study). Besides the unfailing line-for-lineness of the gloss, it's
            the best compact (three vestpocket volumes) Gottfried encyclopedia
            available, with all the <I>Literaturwissenschaft</I> since that
            science was invented. No mean feat, this.
        </p>
        <p>Narrative clarity has to
            come first, of course, as far as that gets us. But Gottfried charged
            <I>Tristan</I> with lexical, auditory, metrical, and structural
            device. I am not the first scholar to fall for the notion that this
            text must conceal a key of some kind. Translation has to reveal as
            much of its machinery as possible. I try to save, or fake, what I
            can, just a routine humiliation for such a task (<q>The
                translation&mdash;liquid Urdu turning, word by word, to English
                stone,</q> as V. S. Naipaul put it). By no means could I reproduce
            the inerrant cascade of Gottfried's rhymed couplets, only shadow
            their meter (which I do slavishly, line by line). So by no means can
            I claim to have <q>translated</q> this anthem with all its
            harmonies into a speech that uses an entirely different set of them.
            But the identical-rhymed quatrains index structural units (I'll
            explain in a minute), and so had to be rhymed somehow. The poet
            himself bent and twisted things to make them work. That's what poets
            do: take risks.
        </p>
        <p>Hatto, regretting the
            <q>incalculable loss,</q> opts for the <q>form which
                (whatever its defects) is not intrinsically absurd&mdash;plain prose</q>
            (<I>Tristan</I>&nbsp;, 9). Rather a hard judgment on versifiers, but
            fortunately his tuneful, accurate prose is far from plain. But if you
            believe, as you should, that this piece belongs among the truly
            great, you may wonder what you're missing. The translator knows.

        <p><q>When one comes to
                such passages one wonders why one ever thought of translating, so
                poor is the return. For the rhythm of Gottfried's verse, the music of
                his rhymes binds opposites together triumphantly, strange though it
                all is in logic</q> (<cite>Tristan, 16</cite>).
        </p>
        <p>There it is. The music is
            what <I>makes it make
                sense</I>. Students of
            Bach will nod wisely. Gottfried creates here, and often throughout, a
            verbal equivalent, let's say, to the musical device of <A
                HREF="http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/COR_CRE/COUNTERPOINT_Lat_contrapunctus_.html">counterpoint</A>,
            sequentially opposing dissonances to propel adjacent voices through
            cadences to resolution. It can't be exactly translated, but it can't
            be left out. I don't claim that my net yield <A HREF="Prologue.html#To%20their%20world">(lines
                55-68)</A> is any better than Professor Hatto's. I have just
            harvested it using a different set of risks. So it should make a
            different kind of sense. A <I>musical</I>
            sense.
        </p>
        <p>Gottfried also used
            counterpoint when building his plot. In my essay <q>The Raw and
                the Cooked</q><cite>(Monatshefte 76 [1984], 131-142)</cite> I charted
            Tristan's binary career between repeated crash and culmination.
            Conceived in despair, he has to save a crown, never mind poisoned
            wounds, magic potions, palace intrigues, royal jealousy, a dragon (of
            course), the dizzying hithers and thithers of heroism. Every
            adventure requires cadence into wreckage, then modulation into
            chorale. Often literally, to Tristan's unheard-of skill at musical
            harmonization.
        </p>
        <p>I think a still more
            profound harmonic dialectic informed Gottfried's whole purpose, a
            case I'll argue after some further preliminaries. The design is
            scalar, by which I mean implicit at every level. For example, watch
            Gottfried playing with the very sound and shape of his own voice (as
            I try to echo it), with his rhyme, from the beginning. He follows his
            first five quatrains in <I>Kreuzreim</I> (abab) with five in
            <I>umarmender Reim</I> (abba), forming a 5X5 <I>Kreuz</I>, bracing
            its symmetry with the identical rhyme, which he then caps with a
            cryptogram <I>Kreuz</I>&ndash;quatrain, framing the initial
            cryptogram letter with the second, so founding the most exalted
            feature of his poetic architecture while leading into its prime
            fabric, his trademark eternal cascade of perfect rhyme pairs, whither
            no poet, least of all such as I, can follow. In fact it's all I can
            do to follow what I have just said, but let's get on with it.
        </p>
        <p>Technically formidable,
            yes. But only the beginning. It's the cryptogram (well-known to
            scholars) which marks the divisions of the macrostructure. Take as
            example lines 1751&mdash;1869. A letter of Gottfried (e.g. O) heads
            an identical-rhymed quatrain, followed by a short reflective or
            philosophical passage. Then a Tristan letter (e.g. R) heads another
            quatrain, an Isolt letter (e.g. S) a second meditation, then the same
            letter (S) the third quatrain, and finally the narration resumes with
            a second R (it's less confusing <A HREF="http://stavenhagen.net/GvS/Childhood.html#1751">to
                see it</A> than describe it). Ignoring these letter-and-rhyme games,
            as prose must, leaves a main brace out of the poem's scaffold.
            Gottfried teases us to take it seriously, for example, by setting
            Isolt atwitter at having decoded the name <I>Tantris</I>
            with literally preposterous
            perspicacity (10100--10122, 10598--10625). See? No minor poet, he.
        </p>
        <p>This elegant
            back-and-forth scheme appears with less consistency as the text
            progresses, exposing all too regrettably the unfinished state of the
            work. Consider for example the identical-rhymed quatrains at 233-240,
            or the orphan at 11871, which seem stray where they stand, having no
            obvious (to me, at least) structural function at that point. I
            imagine the poet, ambushed during practice by inspired rhyme sets too
            good to waste, parking them momentarily for later use elsewhere.
            Other structural asymmetries abound. But enough of the system can be
            seen to show how the whole was intended to work, had Gottfried been
            able to oversee an <I>Ausgabe
                letzter Hand</I>. The
            same sturdy framework of alternating recitative and chorale charged
            the <A HREF="http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/CAL_CAR/CANTATA_Italian_for_a_song_or_s.html"><I>cantata
                    da chiesa</I></A> half
            a millenium later with its four-square, full-rigged power.
        </p>
        <p>But what was the
            cryptogram really for? You can't hear it in recitation, the vehicle
            normal for literature up to Gottfried's time. It only shows up across
            many written folios, and then only if you have caught its first
            signals and are looking for it. The 13th-century reading public
            hardly contained a major college of philologists. Not even the
            scribes of the main surviving manuscripts spotted it. (Michael Batts,
            at the University of British Columbia, first laid it out in full
            detail: <I>Gottfried von Strassburg</I>, New York, 1971). What was
            Gottfried up to? I'm coming to that.
        </p>
        <p>As to the poet himself,
            scholars hasten to admit that we know nothing about him. But no other
            work of his era seems so frankly confessional as does <I>Tristan</I>&nbsp;.
            Gottfried keeps addressing us in his own voice, with declarations,
            puns, asides, jokes, plus long harangues on art, religion, sex,
            morals, his competitors, or whatever. And don't miss the thrilling
            antic comedy of the dragon fight&mdash;he can do color too. But
            working the fine arts, languages, architecture, magic, legend, myth
            both classical and vernacular, and like refinements into the
            operation of his story, he displays an education far more liberal
            than was common to his fellow poets. Getting it had been no pleasure,
            if we can judge from the rigors Tristan suffers on the path to
            prodigy:
        </p>
        <div class="onecol">
            <PRE>On the early blossoms of his joy                2079
fell the frost of care and trouble
that makes things hard for many a youth,
and wilted the flower of his joy. 
Amid his first freedom 
all his freedom was removed. 
With the duties of books and learning
his troubles had begun in earnest (and so forth)</PRE>
        </div>
        <p>
            In this connection, a useful detail
            emerges when Gottfried describes how Tristan first stuns Marke's
            court with his musicality (lines 3505 ff.). King Marke, beginning to
            suspect more than meets the ear, inquires what other instruments the
            boy can play. Tristan tops his list with the <I>sambjut</I>. Nobody
            else has even heard of it. Exactly the effect intended. And that's
            the <I>only</I> effect intended; Tristan never plays it for us, nor
            is it ever mentioned again.
        </p>
        <p>In Gottfried's day a
            superior version of the wheel-bowed viol or hurdy-gurdy, the <I>sambuca</I>
            in Italian, served in the church
            schools as one of the main implements for teaching music theory and
            performance, both vocal and instrumental. As one of the first
            European instruments capable of multiple voices, in design and
            compass it was as far above what later became its ordinary
            sidewalk-music counterpart as was Gottfriedian verse above
            street-corner doggerel. Gottfried, plainly, had been through music
            school, at the dawn of <A HREF="http://www.bartleby.com/65/po/polyphon.html">polyphony</A>,
            and was proud of it. This fact tallies nicely with Gottfried's
            penchant for complex narrative structure.
        </p>
        <IMG SRC="./img/sambuca.jpg">
        <p>As Tantris <I>cognito</I>&nbsp;,
            the hero takes musicianship for his cover on the perilous first
            voyage to Ireland. When he turns harp and song to beguiling his
            mortal enemies, a sophisticated trickery, Gottfried the pedant
            interrupts to preach sincerity as indispensable for true performance
            (7524 ff.), although the untutored can be taken in: Tristan's
            harmonious pretense has just stopped the Irish coast guard dead in
            the water. What bumpkins. Later, the pedant strikes a more playful
            note by having the girl Isolt bedazzle domestic and alien royalty
            with her encyclopedia of exotic musical forms (8058 ff.), learned
            from her tutor Tantris, with which his poet-creator, of course, had
            endowed him. And Tantris knows perfectly well when he must put his
            whole heart into his playing. He uses it to save himself from poison,
            by charming Queen Isolt, while at the same time, as the script calls
            for, initiating his ultimate destruction, by also captivating the
            Princess Isolt (7820 ff). Music is a dangerous thing. You <I>must</I>
            know how to handle it. None who don't need try to write classics.
        </p>
        <p>The nucleus of the
            Tristan legend has to do with just such arcane forces. Expressed as
            the disruptive power of the female into the bastion of androcracy,
            these influences must be at least coeval with tribal chieftainship.
            We can retrace through retellings before Gottfried's how their power
            evolved from the dawn of heroism through the decadence of
            <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohenstaufen">Hohenstaufen</A>
            twilight. Gottfried says he selected, very purposefully, a correct
            version of it to retell, putting us on notice that he has intentions
            of policy beyond entertainment. In doing so he made fundamental
            changes.
        </p>
        <p>First, he absolved the
            particular woman, his Isolt, from any personal malevolence by
            distilling the active ingredient of witchcraft into the magic dose,
            making it work permanently, indiscriminately, on whoever mischanced
            to swallow it. It's possible that Gottfried didn't invent this twist
            (known earlier versions let it wear off), but he used it originally.
            It leaves Isolt merely beautiful, but otherwise innocuous, her native
            state. In her un-potioned condition, for example, sheer femininity
            renders her unable to kill Tristan (10276-10280). Post-potion, all
            she can do is dodge and intrigue to survive royal justice long enough
            to die with him. She is not the agent of their destruction, just a
            component of it.
        </p>
        <p>But the toxin has only
            been mediatized. Her mother, the <I>Ur</I>-Isolt, retains the full
            gender-specific potency of witchcraft. Her concoction wreaks disaster
            with archaic virulence. Bivalent as magic proverbially is, she too,
            and only she, not her virgin blossom daughter, has powers to
            resuscitate the enfeebled and disguised Tristan from impotence, no
            less a prerogative of witches than invoking morbidity in the first
            place. (Gottfried's source, Thomas, In his finale, has the dying
            Tristan send for the <I>daughter</I> Isolt to heal him. Had Gottfried
            made it this far, how would he have rhymed this plot discord?) On the
            same foundation with this atavistic contradiction rests the ornate
            and menacing temple of medieval <I>minne</I>&nbsp;, about which I'll
            have more to say later. Here it gets abstracted and enshrined, as
            though bottled and stoppered for eventual use as needed, or
            accidentially if fated. <I>Minne</I>, not Queen Isolt, is the
            destroying angel. She, with touching maternal instinct, meant no harm
            with her specific, claims Gottfried, only to palliate for her beloved
            daughter defloration by an alien monarch. Warning Brangaene how
            dangerous this concoction is, she drops from the free narrative
            tetrameter into twelve lines of compressed, anxious, triplex whisper:

            The humps and holes cancel, like interfering energy waves, or matter
            against antimatter, whatever. To make this work in English I need one

            have to do. But let no reader miss these metrical physics. Sure
            enough, when <I>these</I> two lovers fuse, it's all over. In just two
            lines. 1 + 1 = 0. Or in Gottfriedspeak, Sex + Love = Death. Please
            listen closely. Here is the fundamental, nuclear, <I>musical</I>
            equation of Gottfried's <I>Tristan</I>.</p>
        <p>Poison, wishes, spells,
            all magic, work with oracular perversity. Boilerplate. Everyone knows
            the story, there's no suspense, the two poor kids mistakenly take sex
            poison, they scandalize kingdoms, they die. How does Gottfried put
            new life in the old tale? Once our two ruling-class adolescents are
            confined on shipboard, they fall for each other <I>to the tune of
                Gottfried's seductive rhymes</I> so tenderly, inevitably,
            paronomastically (11985-12029) that the fearsome medicine is left
            with no more smack than some faint extract of red herring. A glass of
            good plain wine would have worked as well, and plain lust as we know it can
            account just fine for all that ensues. What's going on here? Ahh,
            that I could have watched his face and read his voice while he
            delivered these lines&mdash;
        </p>
        <div class="onecol">
            <PRE>a virulent love-potation,               11435
designed and intended
with exacting artifice
to have this certain power&mdash;
with whomever one should share it,
that person, involuntarily,
must one desire above all else,
and so the other in return.
To them a single death and life,
a single grief and joy was given .</PRE>
        </div>
        <p>
            &mdash;<I>this certain power&mdash;</I>
            there it is. It's not in the bottle.
            It's in your gonads. And while we're at it, feel the crescendo from
            trimeter (11435-37) to the contracted four stresses in 11438, giving
            that line its full punch (yes, that's how it is in the source).
        </p>
        <p>Now, where were we? All
            right. The other change makes a bigger difference. It is in the way
            Gottfried told the story. Although we can't be certain exactly how he
            would have ended it, he proclaimed at the beginning his intention of
            keeping faithfully to his source, written in French by a little-known
            Thomas of Britain or Brittany some fifty years before. Thomas
            melodramatically destroys the lovers through the perfidy of yet
            another Isolt, whom the exiled Tristan married as a pale surrogate
            for the real thing (I reckon all this into the binary plot cycle in
            <q>The Raw and the Cooked</q>). There seems little reason to
            suppose Gottfried would have changed this outcome materially. It
            follows his scheme of wild swings between heights and depths, while
            getting nowhere, and fits exactly at the nadir of the last plunge
            (Hatto translates Thomas' surviving finale, 301-353).
        </p>
        <p>But in retelling it
            personally, ironically, magisterially, Gottfried takes possession of
            the myth. He turns it into a manifesto. His poem as much confesses a
            belief as goes in search of it. He never came back from that trek,
            nor have those of us who go looking for him ever found the body.
            <I>Tristan</I> is the only map we have, and exasperatingly misleading
            it has proved to be. Well, we have missed plenty of clues, and set
            out blind. How about this one?
        </p>
        <p>Puzzling inconsistencies
            on this map come into altogether new focus if we start out supposing
            that Gottfried, as men with his gifts and problems sometimes are, may
            have been homosexual. Take Marke's first look at the boy Tristan, for
            example, not through Marke's eyes but through their creator's:
        </p>
        <div class="onecol">
            <PRE> . . . well he knew the courtly stride.         3333
He also had the stature for it,
a presence shaped by love:
the mouth, full and red as any rose,
bright of countenance, clear of eye,
full the hair in brunette ringlets,
ending in a curl . . .  (and so forth),</PRE>
        </div>
        <p>
            and again when Marke is paying closer
            attention:
        </p>
        <div class="onecol">
            <PRE>. . . when he reached for the harp,                     3547
it seemed to belong in those hands,
so well-formed, as I have read,
that hardly could they have been finer, 
soft and smooth, slim but long, 
almost like white ermine . . . (and so forth).</PRE>
        </div>
        <p>
            The word I render here as <q>love</q>;
            (and more demonically elsewhere, depending on context) is Gottfried's
            <I>minne</I>, one of the defining concepts of medieval social theory.
            It encompasses romantic-sexual attraction, much stylized and
            personified in the finer sorts of encounter, while always implying
            the manic power to destroy that so fascinated Gottfried. But I no
            longer believe that Gottfried was thinking here only in the artifices
            of troubadour <I>minne</I> when shortly afterward Marke announces
            that he has found in Tristan something he'd rather have than a wife.
            On this momentous occasion, instead of giving Marke a set speech on
            issues of state, which court protocol surely demanded, Gottfried has
            him advertise what fun the two of them will have living together:
        </p>
        <div class="onecol">
            <PRE>Come back here to me . . .                              5151
. . . God knows we'll live out our days
contentedly with each other . . . </PRE>
        </div>
        <p>
            A little earlier, at their first
            meeting, he had already specified what that would entail emotionally:

        </p>
        <div class="onecol">
            <PRE>. . .<q>Now, listen, Tristan,</q> said the King,             3721
<q>you have all that I desire, 
you can do all I want,
in hunting, languages, and music.
We'll be companions, you and I, 
you mine, and I yours.
By day we'll ride to the hunt,
and evenings indulge here
in pleasures of the court,
with the harp, the fiddle, and song.
What you know best, you shall do; 
I also know a trick or two
that I expect will please you well . . . </q></PRE>
        </div>
        <p>
            He's a handsome, blue-blood teenager,
            you recall. But it won't go smoothly. Now that Tristan, newly
            sword-girt, can't wait to sort out feudal inequities with it,
            Gottfried repaints the glories of Marke's rule, all the monarchial
            pageantry that had so excited Riwalin, as cravenly pacifist, and
            casts Marke himself as literally effeminate:
        </p>
        <div class="onecol">
            <PRE>But as to good King Marke,              6521
the coming trial by combat
afflicted him with heartache
such as no faint-hearted woman
ever suffered for a man.</PRE>
        </div>
        <p>
            In a short time, Marke has fallen in
            love, as we would class it, with his dashing nephew, a sentiment
            Gottfried endorses:
        </p>
        <div class="onecol">
            <PRE>Marke, having seen them off,            7370
looked long after Tristan.
All his joy and peace of mind
now was small, that I know.
This was a parting that penetrated
into his very heart and bones.</PRE>
        </div>
        <p>
            <I>. . .that I know . . .</I> Hmm.
        </p>
        <p>Tristan's allure works
            not only on his uncle, but also when he tutors Isolt. After her first
            few lessons, she stuns all who watch and hear her performance (8106
            ff.). How so?
        </p>
        <div class="onecol">
            <PRE>It was plain that the lovely Isolt      8132
under Tristan's instruction
had made great advances.</PRE>
        </div>
        <p>
            I think I catch a whiff of corruption
            here. The king is soon showing off his prize consort to his familiars
            at court. With the girl's precocity in beginning to absorb potent
            crafts, Gottfried is setting up her coming role of torpedoing the
            masculine bond Marke hoped to make with Tristan. He wants to let the
            bedrock of primal myth show through courtly refinements. The modern
            triumvirate of king, priest (the Bishop of Thamise), and stalwart
            kinsman is going to fall to the archaic magic of a triplex reflection
            of Isolts (mother, princess, and the pale White-hands) just as the
            fatal attractions of a sorceress had unmanned the archetypal
            warrior-chieftan in the age of heroes. Magic rules. Sorry if this
            sends you off toward Robert Graves, chasing mysticoreligious triunes,
            but that's the way to go, cautiously.
        </p>
        <p>Before you dismiss such
            readings as slanted, recall that Gottfried warned us at the very
            outset against forcing all too conventional a construction onto his
            story:
        </p>
        <div class="onecol">
            <PRE>It's not that common world I speak of. . .      (50)
. . .To [your] world and the one I live in,
what I say means different things--</PRE>
        </div>
        <p>
            He insists, rather, that without the
            right tilt, we shall entirely miss the point. The implications
            multiply when we assume that Gottfried's views were colored by his
            particular gender orientation. All this is connected somehow,
            intimately, with his allegiance to a special congregation, the
            famously enigmatic Noble Hearts.
        </p>
        <p>What defines them?
            Gottfried reads us their credo in a daring see-saw ballad of
            incongruous opposites, condensable essentially into life versus death
            (45 ff). A stoic elite inhabit a world that is prepared to integrate
            death into life, pain into joy. While dedicating himself irrevocably
            to fellow citizenship with them, he undertakes to palliate the
            anguish of such drastic conflation <I>by means of his work itself</I>&nbsp;,
            a poetic history of yearning. This stated ambition will have much to
            do with how I assess his accomplishment.
        </p>
        <p>His pronouncement falls
            into two broad parts, both programmatic for <I>Tristan</I>: it is
            intended exclusively for that elite, among whom he belongs, who
            accept death; and the remedy for that calamity shall be art. This
            passage (45-130) begins a proof of the proposed therapy with
            unparalleled melodious sentience.
        </p>
        <p>How extraordinary. Not a
            word about the Christian machinery universal in his world for
            obviating death. Exactly at the obligatory juncture for fervent
            piety. Note too that in paraphrasing Hartman as his model (below),
            Gottfried leaves the God clause out entirely. He changes the
            beneficiary to his Noble Hearts club. More extraordinary: nowhere in
            this <I>tour de force</I> on sex and death is there an even
            marginally pious appeal to divine salvation (well, Tristan's foster
            parents are tenderly sent to heaven in lines 18660-69). To infallible
            judgment, yes, over and over, including a notorious, ironic dismissal
            precisely of that (15733 ff.) To remission in paradise, never. How
            extraordinary! I think we have here a case of what Claude
            Lev&iacute;-Strauss would have generalized as a structural
            parallelogram, a way of organizing experience or phenomena into
            bipolar categories typical of but widespread not only among
            preliterate societies:
        </p>
        <div class="onecol">
            <PRE>[    faith &ndash; death = life      ]
[  noble hearts + death = art  ]</PRE>
        </div>
        <p>
            When death is positive, the equation
            describes the cosmos of Tristan. However homosexuality may be
            defined, those who&mdash;let's say&mdash;practice it, accept death in
            the sense of renouncing the physical perpetuation of life. They will
            leave no offspring. They also accept (we're in the Middle Ages here,
            you recall) a minority role condemned and often bitterly persecuted
            by those devoted to the system described in the first, death-negative
            formula. Such boundary conditions plainly imply a nobility of heart
            and total reliance on some kind of exogenous solace, which Gottfried
            <I>aspires to supply</I>, as art. Furthermore, uncoupling sex from
            its one sanctifying function leaves it a moral loose cannon, the
            destructive rampages of which Gottfried tragico-lustily chronicles.
        </p>
        <p>As to cracked weapons,
            thigh wounds, impotence, masquerade, and their poetic encryptions, I
            have already said quite enough about Gottfried's sword-phallicity in
            <q>The Raw and the Cooked.</q> Now I have to put bigger issues,
            the literary ones, in context.
        </p>
        <p>Among his contemporaries,
            Gottfried admired Hartmann von Aue (1165-1215?) for his lucid style.
            In his program of creating therapeutic art by translating from the
            classics, Gottfried was following Hartmann's example, set forth in
            the pious legend <I>Der arme Heinrich</I> (before 1197):

                <PRE>           Hartmann:

There was a knight so learned
that in many books he read
whatever he found written there.
This man's name was Hartmann,
serving the court at Ouwe.
He searched here and there
through various books.
It was his hope in doing so
that he might find something
to relieve the burden      10
of difficult hours
which would also be such
as to show reverence for God,
and in this way be able
to render a pleasing service.</PRE>

           Gottfried:

I have searched . . . everywhere,    157
in all the books, of both kinds, 
Latin and not Latin, 
and taken the greatest care and trouble 
in writing this poem
to follow his [<I>sc</I>. Thomas'] example. 
After much searching,   
at last in one book 
I read all that he has said 
about how this adventure goes. 
And now from all my reading there 
about this history of longing,
I have chosen to present
the tale to all noble hearts
as a pleasure and diversion.</PRE>

        <IMG SRC="./img/hartman.jpg">
        <p>Hartmann tells how the
            noble lord Heinrich, stricken with leprosy, learns that only
            sacrifice of a pure maiden can heal him. A peasant's daughter,
            zealous for eternal bliss, volunteers. Strapped naked to the altar,
            she is about to be sliced up by the physician-priest when Heinrich
            peeks through the keyhole and halts the procedure out of compassion
            (at first much to the girl's pious annoyance), whereupon, of course,
            all goes happily ever after.
        </p>
        <p>Gottfried adopted the
            style and program, and even the scene, but not the ending. He has the
            afflicted Marke peer through a little window in the sex cave on the
            lovers' <I>pose of mock innocence</I>, which convinces him to rescind
            their banishment. The entire act can be read (I do so read it) as a
            travesty on Hartmann's pious <I>d&eacute;nouement</I>. Far from being
            redeemed, Marke has yet more with which to fool himself. Gottfried
            sourly observes that he is better off to do so:
        </p>
        <div class="onecol">
            <PRE>And he does just as great an evil       13797
who tries to turn suspicion
and confusion into certainty,
for if he should succeed        
in confirming every doubt,
then that which he before aspired
to get to the bottom of
has become a painful thing for him,
beyond every heartbreak.
Those two he started with
that at the time oppressed him
now seem the better evils.
Might he have them restored,
doubt and illusion at least
could make it forever impossible
to know the real truth.</PRE>
        </div>
        <p>
            And what does Marke see through that
            spyhole into the cave? There lies the man he at first loved, for whom
            he swore political celibacy, next to the woman, his intended dynastic
            solution, neither of whom he ever really possessed. Maybe for us, the
            audience, their accidental poisoning could to some extent excuse
            them, but Marke, the protagonist, <I>doesn't know this</I>. Peeking
            at them, he works up quite some carnal steam for his female consort
            (17587-607). Gotttfried puts his own spin on this primal scene: Isolt
            glows with <q>color and radiance, lovely and enticing (and so
                forth) . . . I know not from what exercise, told somehere in this
                story.</q> Oho, we wink, sword or no, what <I>have</I> they been
            doing in that love cave? The sovereign author deflates us with a
            gentle poke in the ribs: <q>I do know, come to think of it, how
                she had exerted herself<q>&mdash; just an early morning stroll.
                    <q>It was the walk that warmed her</q> (17561-74). Not what you
                    were thinking, at all. But overwhelming desire, the same stuff as in
                    the fateful cocktail that has put the lovers there, convinces Marke
                    to exonerate Isolt. <I>Honi soit qui mal y pense</I>. We soon find
                    out (17723-33) that he also has political concerns. He needs to
                    parade her as queen, even though <I>no heir is forthcoming</I>,
                    although that was the whole point from the beginning. Gottfried
                    throughout mocks the issue of Marke's succession, the plot feint used
                    to instigate these misalliances, by leaving Isolt barren despite
                    vigorous couplings with both king and nephew. Red-blooded, potent
                    Hartmann would have toppled off his charger at such diagnosis.
        </p>
        <p>From Hartmann's exemplary
            diction in his setting of the Job legend, Gottfried adopted the idea
            that purity of verse could cleanse even what sensuality may soil,
            impliying a kind of salvation in itself, which he generalized into
            the infallible mirror accuracy of his own rhyme. Art can lead to
            surcease. But he passed over his model's trite preciousness to vent
            his scorn on a case of it made inexcusable by its author's turgid
            diction and plot. This poet, whom Gottfried disdains to name (he can
            be no other than the Wolfram von Eschenbach of <A
                HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram_von_Eschenbach"><I>Parzival</I>)</A>,
            had been going about declaiming a wild tale. If asked for a <I>pr&eacute;cis</I>
            of it, Gottfried might have said: a
            young worthy, ignorant both of his high parentage and codes of noble
            behavior, rampages about defeating all and any who stand against him.
            Revelation and wisdom gradually seep in through hard knocks and wise
            counsel, so that at last he gains control of a magic grail-stone
            residing in its hidden castle, where healing, conjugal bliss, and
            dynastic sovereignty unite in an enlightened rule dedicated forever
            to propagating its <I>pax</I>
            abroad.
        </p>
        <p><I>Bickelworte</I>&nbsp;,
            snorted Gottfried (4641). Balderdash. He was himself composing a work
            that would set all that bliss and health nonsense straight, for a
            select coterie who could stand to face the truth. He was taking the
            facts straight from an authoritative source, instead of fabricating
            at will and then at the last moment citing (as did Wolfram) an
            exotic, unheard-of masterwork. As for that imaginary fortress of joy,
            Gottfried said, he knew all about it. <I>He
                had been there</I>. He
            had known it since he was ten years old (17100ff.). But it wasn't the
            answer. His fictional lovers get to stay there briefly, while over
            them hangs, as a species of Gottfriedian bliss, a sterile melancholy.
            Daily in fear of being discovered, they rehearse ancient incest
            legends, of liaisons inappeasably forbidden and tragic, case
            histories of carnal lust transgressing natural law (detailed in <q>The
                Raw and the Cooked</q>). They are able to ascend the crystal
            monolith and lie there <I>pretending</I>
            impunity, but he, their creator, try
            as he might, has no such luck. He can't penetrate the screen, as does
            Woody Allen's ingenue in <A HREF="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089853/"><I>The
                    Purple Rose of Cairo</I></A>.

        </p>
        <p>He had been there? What
            are we to make of this? Let's backtrack to my speculations about
            Gottfried's early life and education. Among them, Gottfried's one
            portrayal of genuine, familial warmth centers on Tristan's foster
            parents, the stalwart Rual, and his surrogate mother, Floraete
            (3750-4332; see my <q>Rual der Werde,<q> <I>Neophilologus</I>,
                    68 [1984], 400-404). Maybe Gottfried, like Tristan, was born of noble
                    parents in suspect union (later sources deny him the title <I>her</I>,
                    <q>Sir</q>), which landed him, like Tristan, with foster
                    parents. It would then be no surprise, in fact routine, that when
                    maturity threatened he should be interned in a monastic institution
                    for a career ecclesiastical rather than feudal. There he could live,
                    and receive literary and musical education, in a sequestered, sylvan
                    environment summarized in architectural splendor, music, art,
                    letters, and very probably a conflict of sexual license restrained by
                    occasional, irksome surveillance.
        </p>
        <p>Monasteries (Gottfried
            four times calls the lovers' retreat a <I>cluse</I>, <q>cloister</q>)
            insulate devotees of spirituality, heightened by art, from temporal
            corruptions, such as sex, which, as we Darwinians know, is nature's
            way of perpetuating life. But what about intrinsically sterile sex?
            Could it qualify as a kind of abstinence, or at least as
            philosophically benign? Now, in the <I>fossiure a la gent amant</I>
            (surely a wicked pun), which theoretically sheltered Gottfried's
            lovers, as for the Titans, from restrictions on pleasures, they
            commemorate classic incestuous passions, the strictest of
            prohibitions on intersexuality, in the most soothingly melodious
            harmonizations. Need of physical sustenance is also suspended
            (although Tristan had brought gold, presumably against such needs).
            They have perforce left the standard world, to enjoy&mdash;or
            endure?&mdash; a metaphysical one. Asceticism, abstinence, sylvan
            idyll, retreat, song, revered tradition, all deployed in a desperate
            situation. Sex, hunger, reality as we know it, forestalled. <I>There
                was a time</I>, Gottfried remarks, <I>when I myself/ lived in just
                this way,/ and then it was enough for me</I> (16920f.). How shall we
            read so peculiar a confession?
        </p>
        <p>Here a short detour,
            which I trust merges with the thoroughfare. Gottfried set himself off
            from his fellow poets most distinctly by his fathomless irony. One
            capital instance will suffice, not to sidetrack the argument too
            long. Isolt, facing a drastic test of her chastity, reminds God of
            his <q>courtliness</q> (<I>h&ouml;fscheit</I>, 15552), his class
            obligation to be a good sport about the trick she is inventing. She
            contrives to land as though by mishap in the disguised Tristan's
            arms, so that she can include him in her oath listing the only men
            she has ever lain with. Calling off her bodyguard as she falls, she
            jokes,

            This powerful remark, bursting in the
            midst of her trial on charges of royal adultery, has so many levels,
            like the ruins of Troy, that we know not how deep lie hidden Priam's
            glories. They shine throughout the heap. When Isolt reaches into the
            fire, we watch the dramatic climax of the whole story (exactly at the
            word <U>not</U>
            [=<I>niht</I>]
            in line <A HREF="http://stavenhagen.net/GvS/Trial.html#15730">15732</A>).
            But Marke and his jury <I>don't
                know what they have just seen</I>.
            While we all hang, wondering what next, Gottfried <I>in
                persona</I> strolls
            onto the proscenium (15733ff.) to remark that Christ, as divine chief
            executive, can be persuaded even to suspend physics, <I>if
                that is what you really want</I>.
            I doubt there is another scene anywhere in medieval letters to equal
            this one for sheer dramatic force. Is Gottfried's Eden-<I>M&auml;rchen</I>
            in fact a bitter parody? Be warned.
        </p>
        <p><I>There was a time . . .</I>
            Gottfried muses. But no more. The lovers, when Marke recalls them,
            simply leave their paradise, without a word of regret or foreboding,
            for the real world of intrigue, judgment, and condemnation. In doing
            so they reconstitute themselves as mortal humanity. Gottfried is
            telling us here that he <I>went with them</I>, leaving the uncanny
            dimension that pertains in the love cave, his most poetic of
            fictions, to reality, where hunger, unsatisfied yearning, sex, and
            death define life as we know it, and all have to be accepted somehow.
            His expedition to the central bastion of purity, like an assault on
            the Castle of the Holy Grail, fell short. All the machinery of ritual
            and abstinence turned out to be no match for the flame-sworded
            cherubim that forbid us the Tree of Life. There would be for him no
            joyous tandem nuptials in some hard-won, post-conquest reign of
            enlightenment, no magic stone or cup of healing, no <I>love</I>, such
            as perfumes the happily-ever-after of Parzival's sublime reign. So
            what was left?
        </p>
        <p>The one thing he still
            believed in: <I>cristalliniu wortelin</I> (4629).
        </p>
        <p>A block of crystal,
            however elegantly wrought, seems a hard, cold place for epic
            lovemaking. With its engraved dedications, situate by architectural
            geometry at the focus of a perfectly smooth, white, monolithic,
            otherwise unfurnished cavern, displaying for targeted spectators an
            arfully composed <I>tableau vivant</I> unmistakably like tomb effigy,
            it is a bed in the sense of that furniture's most transcendent
            metaphor, the sarcophagus, and the temple-like hypogeum enclosing it
            a mausoleum, the hidden park-like glade in which the whole is
            sequestered a cemetery, not for re-creation but eternally unchanging
            and commemorative. And whose bones shall lie there?
        </p>
        <p>What Gottfried enshrines
            has to do with his own inability to attain either ascetic salvation
            in monastic retreat or a substitute for it in the supernal carnality
            which he so tenderly allows his fictional lovers to celebrate,
            briefly, in their isolation, who surpass, he declares, even the
            amours of the Titans (17225ff.). The undertone of his personal
            failure drones throughout the story, culminating in the episode I
            entitle <q>Eden,</q> with all its connotation of catastrophic
            loss. And in his famously enigmantic prologue I hear him addressing a
            monument of ironic acerbity to a person he knew intimately, but whom
            we know only as DIETERICH.
        </p>
        <p>It is the poem, precisely
            the poem, that rises to immortality. Approaching the <I>d&eacute;nouement</I>
            of his plot, Gottfried had begun to chisel across the crystalline
            surface of his story a coffin-shaped epitaph <I>marmore perennius</I>,
            in the center of which, just where Tristan had laid that awful sword
            awarded him by his uncle as the emblem of manhood, with which he
            murdered the first nobleman to impugn his legitimacy, a two-edged
            thing which when broken betrayed, then when repaired, united him to
            Isolt, which at last feigned but failed to prove their abstinence,
            announcing instead with its shining nakedness their utter
            capitulation to mortal sexuality&mdash;at that center, now replacing
            the sword, Gottfried himself, Gottfried the now immortal poet, would
            lie, reconciling himself for all time with his creations beside him,
            each in mirror image, like flawless verse:
