                <p> A much-loved form throughout the Middle Ages was the saint's legend. The science of hagiography,
                    strictly speaking, provided official church documentation for the personnel of Christianity. But as
                    the number of saints and the miracles that credenced them proliferated, the stories of their lives
                    and exploits edged into popular literature, taking on more and more a dimension of entertainment and
                    fantasy.
                </p>
                <p> The story of Theophilus has been widely regarded as a preview of the Faust legend, which appeared in
                    northern Europe in the late Renaissance. However, medieval tales of man's struggle with the
                    personified forces of evil form a long and consistent tradition in themselves, built on an idea
                    perfectly typical of medieval thought: the exclusive claim of the transcendental to reality. In
                    fact, when St. Augustine fought free of the doctrines of Faustus of Mileve, who accepted and
                    preached the reality of evil, the Middle Ages had begun. They were over when Dr. Georg Faustus,
                    arch-charlatan of Heidelberg, at last realized (as chronicled in the <i>Faustbuch</i> of 1587) that
                    the delights and possibilities of life on earth, evil or no, at merely the price of his miserable
                    soul, were worth the bargain.
                </p>
                <p> Pre-Renaissance stories of man vs. Satan begin with the sin of pride, as committed by Theophilus in
                    our example, and always end in sublime renunciation of earthly corruption. That is to say, they
                    emanate from and return into a world of pure abstraction. Between these poles, Theophilus goes
                    further than did his legendary forebears in being the first to put the deal in writing. In the
                    latter days of the Middle Ages, idealism had to make more room for harder worries. The material
                    existence of the pact still imperils Theophilus, even after he has thoroughly repudiated its content
                    and meaning. Sin, like other business, needed careful small print. All sorts of abstract values were
                    becoming negotiable commodities, as illustrated most infamously by the market for indulgences, as
                    well as other prerogatives and privileges once supposed to derive only from moral, ethical, or
                    spiritual qualities. The day was coming, we can see, when a soul would be good currency for the
                    price of admission to hell and its wonders. But for Theophilus, the supreme (and abrupt) reward was
                    death, as it had been for all the Christian millennium, releasing him from tangible, mercantile
                    illusions into pure, transcendental reality.

                <p> The Jew here plays his assigned stock role as human agent of magic and deviltry. As a non-Christian,
                    so the reasoning went, he was <i>ipso facto</i> a member of the opposition. Such an assignment was
                    safer, in any case, than admitting that a powerful and effective intellectual tradition might have
                    anything to do with his undeniable talents. In many stories he practices ruinous usury, a business
                    forbidden to orthodox Christians, thus marking himself as a functionary of the Fiend himself.
                </p>
                <p> The other stock character here is one of the most facile and beloved in all medieval narrative:
                    Mary, the holy virgin mother. She performed the executive function in the operation of divine will
                    on earth. Not only does she quietly intercede in visions and dreams to answer whispered prayers;
                    whole cycles of stories tell of her exploits on behalf of faltering humans who have got themselves
                    into every kind of scrape. She wades into the thick of the action when, for example, she magically
                    takes the place of a knight, armed and mounted, and sets things right by knocking her evil adversary
                    for a loop. She was the comic-book masked avenger of her day, a fine example of how the medieval
                    imagination put every ideal into tangible form, or conversely, inspired all the things of everyday
                    experience with supernal meaning.
                </p>
                <p> The story of Theophilus comes to us from the Greeks, dating at least from the early sixth century
                    a.d., and popularly connected with a vicar under a bishop of Adana, an important, ancient city at
                    the northeastern corner of the Mediterranean. Greek manuscripts of the story date from as early as
                    the tenth century. But by then, it was also well-known in Latin; so well, in fact, that there is
                    little profit in trying to find exact sources for the many versions in the European vernaculars.
                    Suffice it to say that poets, dramatists, and artists continued to chronicle Theophilus' narrow
                    escape from perdition until he was upstaged by Faust. The version translated here forms one episode
                    in a large cycle of Mary legends composed and collected early in the thirteenth century.
