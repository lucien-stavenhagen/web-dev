                <p> Here is a prime specimen of a very popular type of story, the lay homily. Peopled with favorite
                    stock characters--the wealthy, braggart commoner, the penurious but incorruptible knight, the maiden
                    heiress, the divine messenger--it mixes long-winded adventure with superstition and miracle to
                    produce, apparently, a sermon on one of the several capital virtues by which chivalrous conduct was
                    defined.
                </p>
                <p> Technically, the theory of chivalry divided personal honor into two main categories: an internal
                    quality of uprightness, and the more tangible one of reputation, comprising in addition to moral
                    respect the admiration commanded by splendid possessions and a grand style of living. Our poet's
                    first purpose here is to underscore the mutual contingency of these inner and outer virtues. Sir
                    William deservedly, inevitably, gains vast wealth by moral resolve. Being good still pays.
                </p>
                <p> It follows that writers and readers of the time cared little for distinctions between sacred and
                    secular literature. Good, clean entertainment was in demand, so ripsnorting adventure naturally
                    blended with ethereal piety, or hymns to the Virgin might throb with earthy passions. Theology, once
                    queen of the sciences, exclusive property of the learned, descended more and more, as in this story,
                    into popular fable and superstition.
                </p>
                <p> And the once-glorious edifice of chivalry was literally bankrupt. Through the thin smoke of divine
                    trials and visions, we see clearly the main problem. Here, as in many stories, another member of the
                    formerly wealthy aristocracy, once sole owners and hence arbiters of society, can continue the old,
                    elegant practices of his class only on credit. He is forced to stoop before the new breed of bankers
                    and traders who suddenly were running the world. Successful heroism, in itself, generated no hard
                    profits. There had to be the inheritance (as here), the dowry, the grateful king, the pot of gold,
                    or whatever. Even miracles had to be solidly capitalized.
                </p>
                <p> Still, this fiscalized world gestated with otherworldly forces everywhere--migrant souls hide in
                    dung heaps, visions infest the halls, a horse trade may lead to hell or paradise. How much of this
                    shall we credit to whimsy? It's not easy to say. But the earnestly transcendental centuries
                    preceding must have made it seem wise always to act the gentleman.
                </p>
                <p> The German version of this story, preserved in only a single manuscript copy, is modeled on an Old
                    French epic in Alexandrines (an interminable imitation hexameter). There the hero is named Lyon, the
                    son of one Herpins de Bruges. The German text transplants everything to "Muntaburk," which <a
                        href="../afterward.html#hagen">von der Hagen</a> presumes refers to Montabaur, an old
                    fortification
                    surviving today as a small town between Koblenz and Limburg. In any case, the story seems native to
                    the lower Rhein.
