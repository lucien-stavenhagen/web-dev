                <p>Gender comedy belongs to the ages. The fragility of manliness has always lain dangerously near the
                    foundations of state, making things precarious for the powerful and easy for the satirist. Surely
                    our recently fashionable imperative for tolerance toward gaydom conceals no little <i>Angst</i>.

                    This story, beneath the light-hearted war between the sexes, takes on some big issues by capsizing
                    an ancient myth. Aphrodite's girdle, source of her unfair advantage over every rival, means the
                    eternal, irresistible power of femininity. In our tale, the bright heroine sells her chastity for
                    magic sword-belt powers. A brief male masquerade is then required to channel them to her husband,
                    thus saving his career and re-instituting fidelity in their rattled marriage. Shall he be grateful?
                    Or has she worn the pants (iron ones, here) a little too convincingly?

                    The virgin's belt had analogues in the Germanic classics (pagan Aphrodite, no patroness of
                    virginity, had to restore hers by more bathing than the Germans would have liked). As told in
                    the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>, the great heroic compilation of the early thirteenth century, Queen
                    Brunhilde remains magically indeflorable to Gunther, slack ruler of the doomed Burgundian
                    kingdom, until Siegfried, by combining hard-core valor with magic, bests her in a triathlon to
                    rob her of her girdle. It turns out to be an unexpectedly potent trifle. He gives it to
                    Kriemhild, the wife Gunther has awarded him in payment. She exhibits it to prove that Siegfried,
                    having cuckolded her royal brother Gunther, outranks him. Epic genocide ensues.

                    <q>Sir Heinrich</q> achieves results more benign, better in tune with attitudes much changed since
                    Siegfried's unforgiving days. She can be femininely irresistible and yielding, or martially
                    invincible, when properly equipped. But her strength in the tourney seems to come as much from
                    somewhere within as from her illicit booty. The strength is real, of course, not magic, and the more
                    warmly human and funny for it. Sir Conrad suffers from deficiencies that mere desperado courage
                    can't cure, aggravated also by the doubtful construction he puts on the code of honor (by deserting
                    her) and then on the rules of manly comradeship. She at last invigorates him by conferring on him in
                    forgiveness not magic but herself, like a critical ingredient. They live happily not ever after but
                    to their fill of worldly years. Beneath the magic and fantasy, life is real.

                    On a social level, we hear several themes typical of late medieval stories. The extravagant passions
                    of the adultery scene are not just gratuitous prurience. Chivalry, seen through the magnifying glass
                    of popular imagination, demanded not only fabulous bravery, wealth, and skills, but also outsized
                    sensibilities as the marks of distinction normal for its so exclusive membership. A knight who did
                    not rave, vault bulwarks, swoon, or take wild vows at the sight of a highborn lady was no knight at
                    all and would have poisoned the whole game. Our author is making sure everyone knows his errant has
                    top qualifications, although his only function is to inseminate the plot, so to speak. He quickly
                    spends his magic equipment and is not heard from again.

                    Consider also the new role for woman. The grandest days of chivalry had called for a lady who stood
                    at the opposite pole from her lord in most respects. She formed the nucleus around which knightly
                    behavior orbited. She was desired, served, protected, won, lost, traded, and made the type goddess
                    besung in every hymn to devotion and passion (not what we would call love) the poets could invent,
                    but seldom did she <i>do</i> anything. In contrast, Sir Conrad's consort fights henceforward at his
                    side. This knight and lady together form a kind of social unit chivalry never knew.

                    Another invention is marked by the debut of the innkeeper as tournament capitalist. Here he acts
                    only as agent and confidant; later stories will show him also as speculator in knightly futures.
                    Such commerce between lord (or lady) and churl would have been unthinkable in Parzival's day, but by
                    Sir Conrad's time was just business as usual. Dash and bravery had slipped over to the nostalgia
                    side of the ledger, and if you still wanted to bet on them, the stake had to be in hard currency.

                    Typical also is the attention paid to the meaning of personal appearance. For a long time,
                    convention had decreed that external splendor necessarily bespoke intrinsic quality (and <i>vice
                        versa</i>). A champion was at once recognizable as such, anywhere. Occasions for descriptive
                    pageantry abound in the literature of chivalry, where poets vied the might and breeding of their
                    hero against all comers by covering him with finery and entraining lordly squires and vassals behind
                    him. (Vassalage was not ignoble servitude but a formal pledge of loyalty. A vassal might be of high
                    birth, gain further power and social standing proportional to those of his liege, and, like Hagen in
                    the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>, personify a culture's proudest virtues. Conrad's offer of fealty to his
                    incognito wife compliments himself, just as much as her).

                    The mighty Breton in our story, too, is marked by his appearance as a champion, and hence certainly
                    a son of the nobility. Yet ingloriously he gets bowled off his horse by a woman. Protected though
                    she be by magic, the author still instinctively prepares his audience for such an astounding
                    inversion of natural law by sending her into the ring only after a <i>cap-&agrave;-pie</i> review of
                    her outfit. The equipment makes, in this case spuriously, the man.

                    Magic belts, swords, capes, and like implements, of course, are nothing new in literature.
                    Conventionally, they mark, not make, the heir or worthy, who alone can master them. The unfit have
                    no more success with them than Penelope's suitors with Odysseus' bow. But in this age of fading
                    valor, it was the storytellers who kept the faith. Power, whether rooted deep as the family tree or
                    strapped on with finery, was power.

                    An epilogue names the poet, an otherwise uncelebrated Dietrich von der Glezze, perhaps referring to
                    the old settlement of Glatz, in Silesia, south of Breslau. If that is correct, then Dietrich's
                    patron was probably Wilhelm von Weidenau, a minor nobleman who could still afford to commission
                    entertainments. He died in 1296, according to town records, meaning that Dietrich probably composed
                    his only surviving work not long before the advent of the fourteenth century.
