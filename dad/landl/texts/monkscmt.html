                <p> Medieval comedy more often than not strikes modern sensibilities as drastic. And if life was indeed
                    harsher and more brutish then, as we suppose, maybe people laughed more viciously. Ridiculous antics
                    were routinely used to drive hard moral lessons, as in this scalding attack on corruption in
                    monastic orders. What may seem an incongruous confusion of attitudes comes a little clearer when we
                    see the devout lady and her husband in this story not just as murderous pranksters but God's agents
                    of retribution.
                </p>
                <p> Still, there is no way to heal our surprise at the zest with which church and clergy were attacked
                    and abused (boiled alive, even), saturated though medieval life was with religion and piety. We have
                    to accept a theory of realism that remained throughout the Middle ages the cornerstone of all
                    serious thought: the distinction separating the particular from the general and assigning reality
                    only to the latter. Church, priesthood, holy orders, and all that went with them were vital, as
                    abstractions, as manifestations of divine order, even though <i>a</i> church, <i>a</i> clergyman, or
                    <i>a</i> monk, as a particular specimen, might be just as vile as anything else on earth. As long as
                    medieval attitudes prevailed, even massive corruption in the church failed to damage the sanctity of
                    what the church stood for. A student, however, with nothing to sanctify him but the eternally
                    wrangling university of theologians and philosophers, was another matter, beyond any apology.
                </p>
                <p> The textual history of this story is exceedingly complex, involving a multitude of diversions and
                    analogues, reaching back into ancient Oriental literature.* Our German author, not himself an
                    Alsatian, turned his wit against the friars and drunkard scholars of Colmar (which isn't on the
                    Rhein), where monastic foundations flourished in the latter part of the thirteenth century.

                    <p>*Maybe a ghost of it survives in the fairy tales, where the wicked wolf is prone to land in a
                        boiling vat. An Old French version is translated in <cite>Medieval Comic Tales, ed. Peter
                            Rickard (Rowman and Littlefield, 1973), 4-7.</cite>
