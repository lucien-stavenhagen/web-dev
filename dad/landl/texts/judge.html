                        Faust conjures Mephistopheles.</p>
                        <p>From <cite>Die Historie van Docter Joh. Faustus, die een uitnemende grooten Tovenaer ende swerte Constenaer was (<q>the story of Dr. Johannes Faust, who was an exceedingly accomplished magician and master of the black arts</q>),</cite> Amsterdam, probably about 1600. The Dutch translations of the famous <cite>Historia von D. Johann Fausten (Frankfurt, 1587)</cite> were the first illustrated versions of the story.

            <p> Once there was a judge so wicked that I couldn't begin to list all his vices, nor would it be well for
                  me to do so, even if I were able. People would have taken it as providential had the earth opened to
                  swallow him, such a consummate sinner was he. There were two reasons for his reputation: no one in the
                  land was quite so corrupt, nor so rich.
            </p>
            <p> The judge determined one day to go and inspect his favorite vineyard. Now, the Devil took notice of the
                  judge's intention, and contrived to appear in the vineyard also, in the form of a young lord, very
                  elegantly dressed. There they met. The judge inquired of the stranger who he might be and whence he
                  had come. But the Devil roundly refused to answer.
            </p>
            <p> <q>Listen here,</q> snapped the judge, <q>you'll answer me or suffer for it. Don't you know <a id="acase" href="#ftn">who*</a> you're
                        dealing
                        with? Why, for your insolence I can seize all your possessions or even take your life, and no
                        one can
                        stop me!</q>
            </p>
            <p> <q>Oh, in that case,</q> replied the Devil with a flourish, <q>you shall indeed know my name and
                        pedigree. I am
                        the Devil.</q>
            </p>
            <p> <q>And what business employs you today?</q> the judge demanded.
            </p>
            <p> <q>On this day, I have the right to take full possession of whatever anyone in this town earnestly
                        wishes
                        upon me,</q> explained the Devil.
            </p>
            <p> <q>That I would enjoy observing,</q> said the judge. <q>We'll go together to the market.</q>
            </p>
            <p> Again the Devil tried to refuse, but the judge burst out with a stream of oaths. <q>By God, you will
                        indeed show me your gains today--I swear by God's power and wrath, whereby you and all your kind
                        were
                        brought to the Fall, and by all God's commandments, to which you are subject, and by God's awful
                        judgment, that you'll do as I say--</q>
            </p>
            <p> <q>Ah! Ow! Enough!</q> the Devil yelped. <q>Not for ages have I been so tightly bound--but this can be
                        of no
                        profit to you, and therefore I request that you absolve me.</q>
            </p>
            <p> <q>Indeed I shall not,</q> declared the judge. <q>No matter what happens, I intend to watch your harvest
                        this
                        day.</q>
            </p>
            <p> <q>What I must, I must,</q> groaned the Devil, <q>sore though it pains me. Yet if you knew truly the
                        eternal
                        enmity that divides your kind from mine, you would desist from conjuring me.</q>
            </p>
            <p> <q>I care not how you like it,</q> snapped the judge. <q>And I tell you this: you'll take nothing
                        whatever
                        without my permission!</q>
            </p>
            <p> The Devil smiled. <q>So that's the way the wind blows. Very well, Your Honor, today you shall see
                        marvels
                        you never saw before.</q>
            </p>
            <p> The two elegant lords made their way down into the town, where it was market day. As they passed among
                  the crowded stalls, many a cooling drink was offered to His Honor, the judge, but no one recognized
                  his companion. Suddenly there was a commotion nearby. A big, fat pig had gotten into one of the
                  booths, and the vendor woman was trying to drive it out.
            </p>
            <p> <q>Filthy swine,</q> she shrieked, <q>the Devil take you!</q>
            </p>
            <p> <q>My friend,</q> the judge addressed the Devil, <q>take your pig. You hear what she says.</q>
            </p>
            <p> The Devil shook his head. <q>Unfortunately, I can't. I would gladly have it, did she but mean what she
                        says. That is her pig, and were I really to take it, her remorse would be genuine.</q>
            </p>
            <p> As they strolled on, they passed another woman struggling with a balky calf. <q>Ah, this is the Devil's
                        own brute,</q> she exclaimed.
            </p>
            <p> <q>Now there's a fine calf for you,</q> said the judge. <q>Take it!</q>
            </p>
            <p> <q>Nay, she would regret it if I did,</q> replied the Devil. <q>I have no power to take it.</q>
            </p>
            <p> Another woman was trying to threaten her child into obedience. <q>Oh, you are so bad! The Devil will get
                        you!</q> she hissed.
            </p>
            <p> Again the judge invited the Devil to accept what was offered him, and again the Devil explained that, as
                  much as he would like to seize the child, he could not. <q>She would not take all the money in this
                        market for that brat,</q> he observed.
            </p>
            <p> And so they walked on. The crowd became so thick at the center of the market plaza that they could
                  hardly pass. Suddenly, an aged widow, impoverished and ill, spied the judge, and cried out tearfully:
                  <q>woe to you, so rich, and I so poor! With all your wealth, still you had to have my only milk cow,
                        the
                        one source of my livelihood. I am reduced to begging, for which I scarcely have the strength. I
                        pray
                        to God, by the passion he suffered when made man for the souls of poor mankind, to hear the plea
                        of a
                        poor woman and commit you, body and soul, to the Devil!</q>
            </p>
            <p> <q>Aha,</q> said the Devil. <q>You see, no doubt, that she is in earnest.</q> He seized his victim by
                  the hair and
                  flew straight up with him, like an eagle snatching a chicken, before the astounded eyes of all the
                  townspeople, who watched until they disappeared into the distance.
            </p>
            <p> What further may have befallen the judge, I do not know. But I do know that the Devil has a thousand
                  tricks. He who chooses to deal with him may expect to get the worst of the bargain.
