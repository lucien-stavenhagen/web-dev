            <p> Once there was a farmer who hated his wife. He might even have killed her, had he not feared what people
                  would say. For the bonds of holy matrimony he had only contempt. Having to speak to her disgusted him,
                  and he took deep offense at whatever she said or did.
            </p>
            <p> <q>God preserve me from you,</q> he said, over and over. <q>So help me, I can't wait for death to part
                        us. I
                        hope lightning strikes us both! The Devil himself brought me together with you, and it must have
                        been
                        his mother that gave you to me.</q>
            </p>
            <p> He often tore her hair out and beat her nearly to death, and then, still not satisfied, he would kick
                  and trample her, swearing horribly all the while that she deserved more blows than all the people on
                  earth could give her. Still, had anyone asked him what her faults were, he would not have known how to
                  answer. It hurt her more than all his blows that he was more intent on beating her than on the
                  misdeeds for which supposedly he did so. He could accuse her only of disgusting him.
            </p>
            <p> And so her life was pure misery. No sooner had she recovered a little from one beating than he began
                  again. She would rather have died than suffer such joys of living.
            </p>
            <p> But God willed that her torture should end. One day, a neighbor woman came in, and learning of her
                  troubles, offered to set things right. <q>Don't you worry,</q> comforted the neighbor, <q>he may have
                        it in
                        for you now, but I'll soon have him begging you to let him be sweet to you.</q>
            </p>
            <p> <q>But he hates me,</q> cried the wife, <q>and he doesn't really know why, himself. And he used to be so
                        fond
                        of me! I never disobeyed him, and he really was devoted to me. May the God who saved Daniel from
                        the
                        lions help me, poor wretch! I couldn't begin to count all the blows, kicks, and knocks he has
                        given
                        me. If only he didn't have such fits of anger, he'd be the finest husband on earth.</q>
            </p>
            <p> <q>Just do as I tell you,</q> said her neighbor, <q>and not only will he never strike you again. He'll
                        treasure
                        you more than he would all the Kaiser's gold.</q>
            </p>
            <p> <q>I don't care about that,</q> sobbed the wife. <q>But I'll give you anything I own if you can just
                        make him
                        stop beating me.</q>
            </p>
            <p> <q>Oh, I don't want any reward,</q> replied the neighbor. <q>We've long been friends, and that's enough.
                        Now,
                        do just as I say. When he is getting ready to go out into his fields, lie down and say you're
                        deathly
                        ill. And I'll tell him also that you're sinking fast, and won't last another two days. You can
                        thank
                        your luck that I've come to help you.</q>
            </p>
            <p> With that the neighbor left, and next morning, when she saw the farmer going out to the fields, she ran
                  up to him in tears. <q>Oh, sir,</q> she began, <q>You mustn't go out today. Your dear lady is about to
                        pass
                        out of this life. Death is at hand!</q>
            </p>
            <p> <q>Do you mean it?</q> said the farmer.
            </p>
            <p> <q>So help me God,</q> she replied, <q>if you don't hurry back home, you'll never see her alive
                        again.</q>
            </p>
            <p> <q>For that news,</q> he said, <q>I'd give you ten marks reward, if I had it. At least I can have you to
                        dinner
                        as soon as she's dead. And I'll be sweating blood until she is. Tell the priest to hurry up and
                        get
                        her buried, because I won't go back while the soul is still in her. In fact, you can plant her a
                        little early, to speed things up. I'll be only too glad to pay whatever it costs to get her in
                        the
                        grave.</q>
            </p>
            <p> The neighbor went back to the farmer's house, thinking over what she had heard and wondering what to do
                  next. <q>Your husband certainly is angry with you,</q> she told the wife. <q>But take heart. I'll soon
                        have
                        you back in his best graces. Go get your prettiest dress.</q> A plan was starting to take shape
                  in her
                  mind. <q>In fact, go get everything. Clothes, money, linens. I'm going to patch things up or die
                        trying.</q>
            </p>
            <p> They packed up all the wife's belongings and moved her into the neighbor woman's house, taking care not
                  to attract attention. Now, the neighbor, whom everyone knew to be clever and kind, had long managed
                  very well without a husband, nor was she eager to change her state. She therefore had leisure and
                  facilities to help.
            </p>
            <p> She put the wife in a comfortable, well-shuttered bedroom and set to work. She hauled in an old plank, a
                  bale of hay, and other scraps she found about the house and courtyard, out of which she soon put
                  together a very good likeness of a human body, and dressed it so carefully in the wife's clothes that
                  anyone would have taken it for her corpse. Then she hurried off to tell the priest that her friend had
                  died during the night. <q>Her husband can't wait to have her buried,</q> she said. <q>In fact, he
                        won't even
                        attend, but I'll stand good for whatever it costs.</q>
            </p>
            <p> <q>What do you say?</q> gasped the priest. <q>I should have given her confession, absolution--last
                        rites,
                        before she died--</q>
            </p>
            <p> <q>Of course, of course, but it was her husband's fault that you couldn't. Not only did he refuse to
                        look
                        out for her. He hated her! So name your fee. It'll come from him, I guarantee that. But she must
                        be
                        buried today, and in holy ground, too. Why, she confessed to you often enough, and faithfully.
                        She
                        died suddenly, and you ought to know what the good books say, that no matter how the just die,
                        their
                        souls are safe.</q>
            </p>
            <p> <q>Oh, all right,</q> said the priest. <q>Two marks.</q>
            </p>
            <p> He sent the sextons to fetch the supposed corpse, which they buried with all ceremony. Now, the priest
                  may have been tricked, but not cheated. He still had his two marks coming. The neighbor woman went to
                  collect the fee from the farmer.
            </p>
            <p> <q>Neighbor,</q> he said, <q>take my oxen here, and the plow too. I'm so happy I'll give you half of all
                        I own,
                        if that's not enough. I've hardly been able to wait for this day!</q>
            </p>
            <p> <q>What you pay me is not important,</q> she answered. <q>Anything you've gained was granted by God. I
                        had
                        nothing to do with it. But I will hold you to your offer of dinner, and further, I want you to
                        promise
                        me that if you decide to marry again, you'll come to me for advice. You won't be sorry. I'll
                        find you
                        the perfect woman.</q>
            </p>
            <p> <q>Indeed I will do that,</q> he said, <q>and may the wolves eat me if I don't take your advice. You've
                        done me
                        favors I can never repay.</q>
            </p>
            <p> He was so pleased that he soon forgot all about what had troubled him before. After no more than a few
                  weeks of high spirits, he went to the neighbor and told her he was tired of being single. <q>Now show
                        your neighborliness and help me to new pleasures. After all the talk I've heard of marital joys,
                        I
                        don't want to spend another day without a wife.</q>
            </p>
            <p> <q>I'll take care of that,</q> said the neighbor woman. <q>I'll show you a woman that God used all his
                        skill to
                        make. She has everything. You'd be the luckiest man alive to get her. She's virtuous, modest,
                        and
                        trusts me, so that she would only marry someone I approve of. It won't be easy, but I'll talk to
                        her,
                        and if possible, I'll have you meet her next week. Then we'll see. Maybe she'll take to you.</q>
            </p>
            <p> <q>My lady, I'm at your disposal,</q> said the farmer, bowing. <q>Whatever you say or ask of me, I am
                        ready to
                        do , beholden to you as I am for all my happiness.</q>
            </p>
            <p> Meanwhile, the neighbor had been giving her guest, the farmer's wife, special care. She fed her, bathed
                  her, and saw that she got plenty of sleep in a fine, soft bed with no fleas, carefully draped to keep
                  out the dust. The room was kept full of fresh flowers. The neighbor was an excellent cook, and when
                  she went to market, she freely used the savings her guest had brought from home to buy the finest of
                  everything.
            </p>
            <p> The farmer's wife soon looked more beautiful than any woman for miles around. Her clothes, too, were
                  elegant, not such as peasant women had. Beneath her carefully-sewn blue cloak she wore a daring,
                  fur-trimmed. white stole, which fitted very well. Her cap was draped with a silk scarf. The plain
                  linens she used to wear were no more. Now her shift and skirt were slim and white, sewn with fine
                  pleating. On her embroidered sash there hung a small purse filled with sweet herbs. She was a vision
                  of perfection, from her lovely shoes to the crown of her white maiden's wreath, such as well might
                  have become a lady of high birth.
            </p>
            <p> When a week had passed, the farmer came to learn how things were progressing. <q>I don't know if this
                        will
                        work or not,</q> the neighbor stalled him. <q>I've been trying very hard for you. I told her
                        what a fine
                        man you are, and you have to bear me out, or all is wasted. I said you were loyal, honorable,
                        industrious, reliable, clever, generous, and good, modest, constant, and kind. She agreed to
                        come here
                        today to meet you, but we must keep this business quiet. Come back after mass for lunch with us,
                        but
                        take care not to let anyone know. We don't want to let out anything before we see what's going
                        to
                        happen.</q>
            </p>
            <p> The farmer did as he was told, although he was none too eager to waste his time in church. He fidgeted
                  through the mass, and then, avoiding everyone, he made all speed back to the neighbor's house. She
                  admitted him to the cool, flower-bedecked chamber, where the chairs all had fine cushions. The farmer
                  was received very cordially by his own wife, who so dazzled him that he had no memory of ever having
                  seen her before, or indeed any woman so beautiful. He could think only of how he wanted to win her.
            </p>
            <p> She bade him sit next to her, and their host brought them fingerbowls before serving the feast she had
                  spent most of the night preparing. If he could only have her, he thought, how happy life would be! He
                  was ready to do whatever he had to, out of thankfulness to God and to the neighbor. After the meal, he
                  took the neighbor aside and told her so. <q>Take anything I have,</q> he enthused. <q>Just get me that
                        woman.
                        I'll die waiting.</q>
            </p>
            <p> <q>I haven't forgotten how my late friend, your former wife, suffered such bad treatment from you,</q>
                  she
                  said. <q>Why, I don't know. But if you are cruel to this woman also, you'll make a disgrace of me,
                        because I've been telling her what a fine husband you would surely make.</q>
            </p>
            <p> <q>Oh, no,</q> he cried, <q>I swear by all that exists I'll be kind to her.</q>
            </p>
            <p> <q>Well, we'll see,</q> replied the neighbor. <q>Come back this evening, very quietly, and you can spend
                        the
                        night with her. If she doesn't like you, the fault is all yours, not mine. She's so fine that
                        even a
                        noble lord would be honored to have her. Let's see if you know quality when you find it. The
                        wise say
                        you can't cast pearls before swine.</q>
            </p>
            <p> <q>Ah, if only she will have me,</q> he sighed, <q>I'll pay her more honors than even the priest
                        knows.</q>
            </p>
            <p> <q>I'll be much readier to believe all your promises in the morning,</q> she replied.
            </p>
            <p> The farmer went away then, but came back that evening and spent what he thought was the shortest night
                  of his life. When the neighbor came to wake them, he refused to get up. <q>No, I'm not leaving,</q> he
                  swore. <q>God has given me a heaven right here, and it's only proper that I enjoy it.</q>
            </p>
            <p> He stayed on, night and day, and could not get enough of the pleasures he had there. His friends saw his
                  plow and cart standing idle, and soon found him in his love retreat. They warned him he would go to
                  ruin unless he went back to his labors, but he vowed than nothing short of black magic could pry him
                  away, now that he understood the true value of a good woman. The whole countryside heard about him
                  soon, for he made no effort to conceal what he was doing. He spent everything he owned to stay on in
                  his paradise. <q>I'll starve here by your side,</q> he at last told his supposed paramour. <q>If no
                        one will
                        feed us, I'm resigned to die here, for it would kill me anyway to let you from my sight for a
                        moment.</q>
            </p>
            <p> When his wife saw that he would not earn a living, she decided that love was not worth starving for.
                  <q>Tell me, for God's sake,</q> she said, <q>why my body is so much more precious to you now than
                        before,
                        when you used to beat me, night and day. I'm not doing anything different. I've lain with you
                        just as
                        I always did.</q>
            </p>
            <p> The farmer paled and crossed himself. <q>Is this the truth?</q> he sputtered.
            </p>
            <p> <q>Certainly,</q> she answered. <q>I didn't die. I'm as alive as can be, and have shown you that you're
                        a fool
                        who can't tell right from wrong.</q>
            </p>
            <p> <q>Oh, God,</q> he moaned, <q>just don't tell on me! I'd never live this down. If people find out,
                        they'll make
                        my life so miserable I'll be wishing I were dead!</q>
            </p>
            <p> But it was not the sort of story that could be concealed for long. Soon he was the biggest joke in every
                  village for miles around. He had to let his wife strictly alone, since now he could neither praise her
                  nor revile her without drawing a storm of mockery from everyone. And if you look, you can find many a
                  man that might be deceived by so clever a trick.
