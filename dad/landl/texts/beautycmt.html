        <p> This outrageous little masterpiece is connected somehow with a more elaborate French story, <q>the
                knight who could make both cunt and asshole speak</q> (<i>li chevalier qui faisoit parler les
                cons et
                les culs</i>).*

            <p>*done into audacious English verse by Robert Hellman and Richard O'Gorman, <cite>Fabliaux
                    (Apollo A-134, 1966), 105-121</cite>, and again, with Old French text, by Robert
                Harrison,
                <cite>Gallic Salt (University of California Press, 1974), 217-255</cite>.

        <p>The French version tells how a knight claims this handy power from three bathing fairies as
            ransom for their stolen clothes. Eventually he proves his gift upon a countess. Having heard
            from another victim what this knight could make cunts do, she wagers he will get no answer from
            hers, which she has thoroughly stoppered with cotton, but she loses when her other vent betrays
            her. The German story might have been decocted from the French version or, as seems more likely,
            both are variations on a common source.
        </p>
        <p> The German author (God rest him merry) invented a unique twist. First he splits the maid into
            her two vital ingredients, sex and beauty, discovering by this experiment that neither can go it
            alone. There is nothing original about that in itself, being a trick of allegory, the favorite
            medieval device of incarnating any quality or abstraction and giving it a speaking part in the
            human drama, normally with pedantic intent. But the vices and virtues of allegory are not born
            from, much less reassembled into, a person, like you or me. They make up instead the moral
            cosmos of the Middle Ages, through which the host of souls orbited majestically toward judgment
            day. In our story, the beauty is reunited and reconciled with her sexuality to create&mdash;a
            girl. Now, what is the moral?
