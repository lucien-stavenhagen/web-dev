                <p> Here the author has adapted his tale with psychological acumen, and liberal helpings from a <a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florilegium"><i>florilegium</i></a>. He makes fun of human
                    peccadillos, drawing a pompous lecher of a churchman, a husband eager to stray, and a vain,
                    scatterminded beauty, as each tries to cover his and her tracks into and out of the same
                    disreputable adventure.
                </p>
                <p> But it is gentle fun. He helps us all, himself included, to feel some forgiveness for his sinning
                    characters first by making them just plain human, and then by giving us a scapegoat. The loathsome
                    procuress earns her pay by taking the blame for the others' illicit lusts and flees in the last
                    scene right over the narrative horizon.
                </p>
                <p> In so protecting them, the author shares and merges with his creations, confessing himself to be of
                    the same common flesh. And surely it would have cost a greater poet qualms to conclude such a tale
                    with such a moral. But our man, and with him, we must suppose, the audience of his day, is content
                    to see God's hand at work even in such low business as this. Pure womanhood is rescued despite the
                    impulses of the woman in which presumably it dwells.
                </p>
                <p> The poet announces himself and clubs home
                    his moral yet again in a rather crude epilogue:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p> This is the story that Poor Konrad has composed. May God frown on him who slanders lovely
                        ladies and strips them of honor, and despicable he who never has a good word for pure women!
                        <q>Amen</q> to this says he who is wise. So drink, my friend--let's see you match your thirst
                        for
                        wine with a fistful of sausage. And now my story's done; God bless us, every one!
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                </p>
                <p> In conjunction with the setting, the city of Würzburg, the name can't fail to call to mind one of
                    the most famous German poets of the thirteenth century. Konrad von Würzburg (d. 1287) produced three
                    massive epics and a large body of lesser narrative and lyric verse. We should not mistake Poor
                    Konrad for his famous namesake (or should we?--scholars differ), nor, I think, did he intend any
                    forgery. He was only doing the master the honor of imitating him. The remarks about love's power to
                    numb scruples, joined with divine tolerance of the result, unmistakably echo a theme favored by the
                    earlier Konrad, who, however, was himself rehearsing the work of a still greater master. Gotefrit
                    (modern <i>Gottfried</i>) von Strassburg (d. 1215?) in his immortal story of Tristan and Isolt said
                    what remains still the last word on the conjoined power and corruption of love. A stronger mark of
                    Poor Konrad's hackdom is his ostentation of axioms swept up from popular florilegia of his day.
                </p>
                <p> Only two manuscripts of Poor Konrad's work remain. But the story of the accidentally-procured spouse
                    has a long and almost universal tradition, traceable through many languages and versions all the way
                    back to the threshold of preclassical folklore. Could a real (but now forgotten) Heinrich von
                    Rotenstein have found himself the butt of an ancient joke? We don't know. But the pompous canon of
                    Würzburg, like other heroes of this storytelling age, made by any name a target too broad to be
                    missed. Look not to the heads of church or family, nor even the poets, for good sense. Try your
                    maid.
