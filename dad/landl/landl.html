                    As transvestite tournament hero she inveigles him, incognito,
                    with shocking man-to-man proposition, exposing his honor as
                    sham and redesigning their marriage for more equality.</p>

            <h2>Epilogue</h2>
            <p>A hundred and thirty-four presses declined to publish <i>Lord and Lady</i>. I was trying to get tenure,
                but it's not really the sort of thing that would have helped. Clive James described what happened to
                professional literary study after the disaster of postmodernism:
                <blockquote>By now the damage reports
                    are in and we know that a whole generation of students have had literature killed for them by the
                    way they have been obliged to study it. Instead of the books, they have had to study theories about
                    the books, always on the assumption that the theorists are wiser than the authors. And finally
                    scholasticism, as always, has reduced itself to absurdity, with the discovery by the theorists that
                    there were no authors. There weren’t even any books, only texts, and there wasn’t any history for
                    the texts to emerge from, because history was just a set of signs, too (<cite>As of This Writing,
                        2003, p. 324<cite>).
                </blockquote>

                So there weren’t supposed to be any more readers, either. Just professors. Some years ago I quit
                professoring and became a reader again, like you. Well, I don't know, maybe you're a professor, but
                anyway <i>L&L</i> is now getting several thousand hits per month. So there are still some of us readers,
                and no matter what you may have heard, the books are still there. Let me know what you think:
